The artist is presenting self-portraits (here photography presented in a wood doll like box and a text printed on plexi) ""We are the balance of our genes, our cultural heritage, our way in life, our dreams, and also a product of the way others see us. When flattered or insulted, often we adopt it and use it. These derogatory or rewarding views participate actively in our personal development. Complicated, weak, bewitching, wounded, or hilarious, I think of these views as ""another me"" perceived from another person's prism- fashioned by his culture, heritage, and experiences. We develop ourselves with each encounter, as intimate artworks on the border of incomprehension. When you add ignorance and intolerance to the way others see us, you get preconceived ideas. ""Préconçue"" -Preconceived- is a group of pictographic self-portraits with which I try to illustrate, in a militant way using the ridiculous and the kitsch, some labels society likes to associate with women and femininity.

1,joel degrand,"Uniforms, Outfits, & Accessories We think of the word ""uniform"" to mean the distinctive clothing worn by members of the same organization. However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.).

Interlaced, naked, arising out of a primal glaze, they seem to have been captured at the moment where their Creator, according to Genesis, decides to breathe life into them. Their eyelids are still shut, their poses unstudied. A moment suspended in time when these beings emerge from their primeval matter, before separation when their destinies overtake them with a promise of beauty and eternity arising from this original impulse. Interacting in a remarkable choreography with the romantic grace of a Gericault mixed with a powerful lyricism, they remind us of Rodin. The photographs are printed on high quality Hahnemühle Photo Rag Ultra Smooth 305g and mounted on Dibond (aluminum composite), which is a good alternative to aluminum.

He took them to Duggal, a photo lab in New York with whom Bert had worked for over 50 years, to see if they could help restore them to their original glory. They worked with him for months to ensure that all damage to the pictures was repaired while keeping original details in the pictures intact. In 2010, working with his long time assistants, Lisa and Lynette Lavender (twin sisters who were former top fashion models and muses of Bert), he decided to ""reinvent Marilyn"" through gemstones and crystals encrusted on the photos, which were first shown at an exhibition in New York in 2012 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Marilyn's death.

Upon purchasing my first camera in 1976, I began to seek out bookstores, magazine stands and libraries in search of anything that might help me better understand the medium of photography. Amongst my very first and, most profound influences, was Brett Weston, son of legendary Edward Weston. His work would inform my own sense of form and composition. Brett had an uncanny ability to select appropriate subjects and create truly stunning black & white images. I particularly enjoyed his abstract, high contrast intimate views of both the natural and man-made worlds. He was a true master of B&W photography. This image of a group of 'seemingly' wild horses atop a high prairie bluff dwarfed by a mass of ominous billowing clouds reminds me somewhat of Brett's work.

84,alma haser,"'Teal' is taken from Haser's project 'Stateless'. For the series, Alma has drawn inspiration from the migration of birds to tell a story of freedom and statelessness. The series was first conceived when Alma reflected on her stepfather's plight to obtain a passport in England. Despite living in the country all his life, he was unable to obtain a passport for years due to an error on his birth certificate. Despite being free, he was somehow in limbo.<br /><br />In 'Stateless', Alma conveys this story through birds. ""Migratory birds are mostly stateless and therefore free. They are the perfect metaphor for freedom and identity"", says Alma.<br /><br />The pictures were taken in the Wollaton Hall History Museum in Nottingham, which houses an extensive collection of taxidermy. The teal, the animal portrayed in this piece, is a beautiful and widespread type of duck that breeds in Euroasia and then migrates south. Its exotic blue-green feathers gave the colour teal its very name.<br /><br />The stuffed birds reflect an ambiguous status: the viewer doesn't quite know whether they are dead or alive, but the birds manage to convey a myriad of feelings regardless: dignity, confusion, sadness, resolution. That is the magic of Alma's 'look'. These fascinating portraits also seem to play with the classic genre of portraiture from the Renaissance and Baroque periods, levelling human beings with animals. Their small format and the posers 'dignified' expressions transport us to a time when having your portrait painted in this fashion was a sign of social success.<br /><br />For the 'Stateless' series, Alma has worked with Rise Art to create an edition of 50 prints.

86,joel degrand,"Uniforms, Outfits, & Accessories We think of the word ""uniform"" to mean the distinctive clothing worn by members of the same organization. However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.). Uniforms, and outfits in general, send social signals that usually indicate personal and cultural identity. The idea of dress code works on many levels and is defined in many ways.

I continued my walk but through the days I discovered that the image of that house was still bothering me.

I asked myself if if was possible that these plants were a new species in our world. I decided to study them as a scientist would, and decided to create an herbarium of artificial plants. The systematic and formal decisions function as a botanical study and as an explicit comment on the work of the photographer Karl Blossfeldt.

The reinterpretation of well-known works has long been a tradition in fine art, rooted in the renaissance artists' varying versions of such iconic images as the Last Supper or Madonna and Child. Operating within a more modern context, the images in this series similarly represent the appropriation and re-contextualiztion of classical western paintings. There is one distinct category of European painting in which women are the principal, recurring subject: the nude. In Susannah and the Elders by Tintoretto for example, the viewer joins the elders in spying on Susannah in her bath, while Susannah herself looks in a mirror. The mirror is used to represent the supposed vanity of women to hypocritically nullify that her nakedness was painted for the pleasure of others. The artist paints the naked woman because the viewer enjoys looking at her; however by placing a mirror in her hands the artist morally condemns the woman as vain. Such is the concept of the male gaze in art. The series Patrimony is a modern re-presentation of women from art history, using ""Pin-ups"" and pop-culture images of the 20th Century to deconstruct the way in which women are traditionally represented in art.",14.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nyyUwEv9L._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'14', u'11 in.']","The Judgement of Paris by Reubens,",B00LLPZORW,11.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

I would go up to the roof of my small Greenwich village studio and hold blossoms up against the sky to see the translucence of the petals. That series of 35mm photographs was entitled Sky Flowers and I had many of them printed as dye transfers and cibachromes. In the late 90?s I began to experiment with digital photography and became one of the first to use a scanner as a camera, which resulted in seven books of large format color photographs. Five of them were of flowers, foliage and plant life. When asked about my technique, I simply reply, ""A prayer of gratitude - for the beauty of the flowers, and the eyes to see them with.""

I came across many vacation resorts that were built in the 60's and 70's, that were comprised of interesting spaceship-like houses. Green Bay Resort in Wanli Township was one of them and it still seemed to be functioning. Some of the houses were occupied while others were falling into decay. Each of these developments seemed to have been built with an optimistic spirit in the days when Taiwan was transitioning to become a wealthier nation and was clearly looking ahead to the future. I particularly like the faux castle in the background, which is a separate resort. It is also the result of the economic boom, but is using a completely different architectural language to provide a sense of escape from the every day. Some of these resorts may have begun to suffer when wealthier Taiwanese began to travel further afield for their vacations. As with all photos from theContinental Bounce series, which is the result of a year long around the world trip, I used my very portable medium format camera, Mamiya 6.

However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics.

They had so much pent up energy after a performance, and they really couldn't go out because they would be mobbed. So we were sitting around talking and drinking. Their manager, Brian Epstein, burst into their suite at the Hotel George V to tell them 'I Want To Hold Your Hand' was number one on the American charts which meant they were going to America to be on the Ed Sullivan Show. That also meant I was going to America with them, and I was pleased. America had always fascinated me. Ever since I was a boy in Glasgow watching James Cagney gangster movies, I knew that was where I wanted to be. They were excited about having a number one hit in America. I had heard the Beatles talking about a pillow fight they had had a few nights before, so I suggested it. I thought it would make a good photo to celebrate. At first they said okay, but then John said, no, it would make them look silly. The John slipped up behind Paul and hit him over the head with a pillow, spilling his drink, and that started it. - Harry Benson, Harry Benson Photographs,60 Years of Photograph, powerHouse Books",30.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VUj1Gyv%2BL._QL70_.jpg,22000.0,"[u'30', u'30 in.']","Beatles Pillow Fight, Paris,",B00E3IE1O6,30.0,900.0,24.4444444444,4.0

You hike into a massive gorge with a hundred footwalls on either side of you. You quickly come upon a massive log dam that is extremely slippery making it quite dangerous to get over. Past the log dam, you see a river running through the walls of the gorge, winding down and around for as far as you can see. The only way to go is through the bitter cold water. As you continue on, the walls narrow to arms length and the water rises until you are chest deep in freezing cold water. Outside of the log dam and the extreme water temperatures you have to maneuver through loads of people. Oneonta Gorge has always been a place many frequent, and its sheer beauty explains why. As a landscape photographer, the goal is to steer clear of the people! This is hard here! On this day, I had hiked over the log dam, through the water, past a few dozen people to finally make it to the end, where a picturesque waterfall pours nearly 100 feet into the gorge. I pulled out my camera, set up and took a second to take in the scene. It was at that point where I finally had been all by myself. Just the waterfall and I!

Many of these photographs were never printed or shown to public, until Bert discovered them in a box some 40 years later. He took them to Duggal, a photo lab in New York with whom Bert had worked for over 50 years, to see if they could help restore them to their original glory. They worked with him for months to ensure that all damage to the pictures was repaired while keeping original details in the pictures intact. In 2010, working with his long time assistants, Lisa and Lynette Lavender (twin sisters who were former top fashion models and muses of Bert), he decided to ""reinvent Marilyn"" through gemstones and crystals encrusted on the photos, which were first shown at an exhibition in New York in 2012 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Marilyn's death.

They wanted to move on to a better life, and certainly to a better neighborhood. Many of the synagogues closed, confirming Eagle's fear, which motivated him to take the pictures. In recent years some of them have been lovingly restored. The famed Eldritch Street Synagogue is among them.

Everything that surrounds us in our homes, in our workplace, and throughout our modern metropolis, has been extracted from the natural world. The man-made world is a world that has been wholly created from the raw materials found on, and just beneath the earth's surface. As it is true that all these items have an origin, it is also true that the components of the synthetic world have a destiny - a final resting place - for when we no longer require them. Their presence in our company is often fleeting. Once it has been decided that they are no longer wanted or needed, manufactured goods are returned to the earth, as waste. Cycles is an ongoing UK based project that looks at the methods and the results of an accelerated climate of consumerism. The images tend to fall into one of two categories; the infrastructure supporting the consumption of domestic goods, and the net results of our consumption. The series was inspired by a sustainability report published in 2006 concluding that in the UK we use over three times our share of global resources. Through my photography I explore issues concerning mans impact upon the land, both individually and collectively, and the decisions and actions undertaken in the name ofprogress.  Motivated by our increasingly globalised society and the implications this has on urban and rural landscapes, as well as on the individual, my work sets out to document the consequences of increased homogenisation and to investigate the nature/culture conflict.",11.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61XEskhP6oL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'11', u'14 in.']","Untitled (Tyres),",B00LLQ1768,14.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

245,joseph shields,"Archival Ink Jet Print. Signed Limited Edition #1 of 15. Printed on museum quality paper with torn edges and floated in 18"" x 22"" off white mat. Paper size is @ 11"" x 14"". ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world. Thanks so much for your interest in my work.

Like a conductor and her orchestra, when I have a camera in my hand, I feel timeless and in control of each moment. I aim to pour intentional emotion, symbolism, and narrative into each photograph; to say all and form a strong connection with the viewer without uttering a word. An important part of my evolving creative journey is looking at the artwork of others and working with artists. Mentors like photographer Stephen Ciuccoli and the forever-luminous paintings of Pierre-Auguste Renoir help shape my style. I admire creators who surpass time, who are willing to take a leap towards madness and shed their souls, to risk rejection or adoration in service of their craft.",24.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51855i106RL._QL70_.jpg,1800.0,"[u'24', u'36 in.']","Against the Sun,",B017MXNFNG,36.0,864.0,2.08333333333,3.0

Since 3000 B.C., this region has been overrun by soldiers from the empires of Alexander the Great, the Persians, the Egyptians, and the Ottomans. (just to name a few). It even contains some of the earliest known Christian churches (in caves) dating from the 4th Century. It's now part of central Turkey, and this region's political stability has brought busloads of tourists to see its unique cultural heritage and exceptional natural wonders. The best way to see the scope of the area is by hot air balloons. When we arrived, winter was settling in, and the weather was cloudy and cold.

In his introduction, John writes that ""Hayman's images and Gander's words are a perfect pairing, not that the photographs illustrate the poems or that the poems describe the pictures. In fact, neither of these artists knew each other prior to this project, but they both create a sensuous, beautiful, yet realistic and contemporary meditation on New York and on the larger American experience that New York suggests...""We met Jefferson when he was an aspiring artist and frame maker in New York at one of his earlier showings in the middle of an antique car gallery. We were immediately sold and knew we wanted to work with him at some point in the future. Jefferson Hayman's images of New York in ""The New City"" not only capture the spirit of the city but they bring us back in time and revisit the New York of Coburn, Steichen, and Stieglitz. Hayman's photographic style is synonymous with the artist himself - refined and respectful, creating economical compositions that leave the viewer completely satisfied.

I am obsessed with all of the steaming, burping, boiling, and exploding landscapes of Iceland, along with the sheep that seem to be inside every crater, and lurking amongst the lava fields. The image is a photograph of a miniature diorama made entirely out of wool and water. After my travels to Iceland I became very anxious to use wool somehow to re-construct the landscape. I learned how to work with raw wool. I cleaned it, dyed it, felted it and learned how to knit. This messy but very rewarding process strengthened my bond to the wool and I became more aware of its nature. I used Kool-Aid to dye the wool. I used Icelandic wool brought back from Iceland, some local wool from an Icelandic sheep farm, and old salvaged wool sweaters that I cut up, felted and dyed. I kept the photography very basic without using any computer based added effects, and I used a macro lens to shoot the images in as much natural light as possible.

Hundreds of negatives that survived in the archives show the reality of the life in the ghetto. Herzog often photographs the same places as Grosman, as they were within the ghetto walls and still bear the signs of the past.""The past is still present in Baluty (the neighborhood, where the ghetto was placed during the World War II); you can feel it in the courtyards, staircases, storages, where there used to be a dovecote"".The history is very important to Herzog. He wanders around Lodz with a camera in his hand, and then he browses through old books, he talks to people, who still remember those times. He captures slogans painted on the walls visibly damaged by the passing time - the slogans which would hurt and offend the former citizens of Lodz. The slogans drawn by the hand of a modern hooligan leave the unquestioned mark on one's attitude towards the history.""Sometimes it was difficult to find an untouched place, free from graffiti.

However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.).

Born Maria Magdalene Dietrich in 1901 in Berlin, Germany, Marlene Dietrich was known for her sex appeal and glamour as one of the leading movie stars in the 1930s and 1940s. Dietrich started acting as a teenager and first appeared on screen in 1923 in ""Tragedy of Love"". Though Dietrich was popular in Germany during the late 1920s, it was her role in the 1930 film ""The Blue Angel"" also made in English, which made Dietrich a star in the United States. After the film, Dietrich moved to the United States and often played a femme fatale in films.

ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world.

She would nonchalantly raise the just lit and perfectly rolled cigarette to her lips, fashionable nail polish glinting in the afternoon sun. And as I say this, I raise the camera to my mind's eye, and there I am with her in that secluded space where all of me is gathered, poised to act, to press the button. I look, I see, the shutter clicks. It all started as a child, much before I had a camera. Now I have one; and when I look at my own images, I discern a quest for harmony, for beauty and for peacefulness. As a man who lives through his eyes, this yearning, this insistence is always with me. I like working outdoors. Light, air and space are oxygen to me; and in general my images reflect that as they tend to be simple and direct- simpy look and you can see. In my world, pictures are about subtle transfers of energy; tiny realignments, really- no drama, no upheavels. These for me are true moments. And for all that I am deeply grateful to Paul Strand, Edward Steichen, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Andre Kertesz, Irving Penn and a multitude of others for teaching me to look at things simply and directly- for the rest truly happens on its own and over time. I am also grateful to and fascinated by the work of photographers like Bill Brandt for showing me that things and people will conform to how we choose to represent them; a reminder that each of us is often the creator of realities that are not just deeply personal but squarely beyond what is commonly known and accepted as the everyday experience.

It was a beautiful summer evening; I was cruising down the Oregon Coast when I came along a very unique setting. The tide was rolling over rocks a few hundred yards out into the ocean, and the sun was soon to set directly behind. The situation was very risky, but I knew it would be worth it. I gathered my gear, and set out, jumping from rock to rock to get as close as possible. With a nice shake in the leg, I made it. The swell was much bigger than it looked from shore. The waves were coming in overhead and breaking within feet of where I was standing. Fortunately the rocks dissolved the waves, and acted as a barrier, allowing me to stand there. Every few waves would come over and get me, making my legs shake. As I scrambled to set up my equipment, the sun was dropping behind the clouds. The magic then happened. The sky lit up with beautiful pinks, purples and oranges, as the water poured over the rocks right beneath me. As I hit the shutter, my thoughts were confirmed. The risk paid off!

And in return they've been poisoned by their industrial neighbors, and not protected from the known hazards that permeate the water, air, and soil of their homes.  But the flags are still flying. A positive/negative film (Polaroid Type 55) is used: a film with an actual negative in it. The chemical is not cleared from the negative, but left to dry, where it patterns, develops crystals, and eats away at the original image - basically decaying, and then printed in that state. This process removes the viewer's ability to immediately place the image in time: it is disorienting and announces that the work is subjective, conceptual and certainly not documentary.",14.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61IYATrCo8L._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'14', u'11 in.']","Untitled,",B00LLPXWOO,11.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

However, from the onset of this series the intent of the photographs was not to imply any notion that consumerism, no matter how it is hyped is good or bad. I am simply taking a closer look and examining the complexities of how we perceive and visualize what goes on in store windows. I am more interested in the reflective, surreal, inside/outside relationship and the visual narrative that sometimes occurs when looking through a store window, both inside the store and outside in the ""real"" world. I want to show these two seemingly different worlds and how they collide into a plethora of interesting visual dynamics. For example, the warmly lit window interiors with still and motionless subject matter and cool daylight penetrating through and reflecting off of the glass. All of this takes place amid a sometimes booming, palpable city complete with sirens, horns honking, and people passing by. Some of the people ignore the reflection of light on the window and it's content inside, and some do an interactive dance around the window to see what's inside. Cupping their hands around their eyes, moving in and out so that outside reflections don't interfere with the quiet solitude of the manikins and sale items, and sometimes non-sale items, on the other side of a thin piece of glass. Rarely, do you see people looking at the reflection on the outside of the glass and the subject on the inside of the glass simultaneously. It's these complex juxtapositions of subject, reflections, color, light, and movement that I find fascinating and try to explore photographically.

Canada The 'North Shore' of Lake Superior is one of this country's remarkable drives, in any season. It's a rugged landscape sparsely inhabited but offers some of the most picturesque scenery. For more than three decades since I moved out West, I have driven the 'North Shore' more often than I can remember. I have passed by Fenton Lake in Lake Superior Provincial Park often, imagining the sweet light on the islands nearest the shore. But it was actually on a rainy day that I captured my favorite image of this area. The rain was coming down hard as I passed this location. There was something so simple and elegant about this view that caught my attention this particular day. I found a safe place to turn around on the TransCanada Highway and headed back westwards, parking on the very narrow shoulder. A few transport trucks blazed by, spraying water all about. Capturing this image required that I photograph the scene from the open hatch at the back of my car, through an open window on the front passenger side. By the time I opened my door and ran to the back of the car to open the hatch, I was completely drenched. With an 80-200mm lens attached to a camera mounted on a sturdy tripod, I framed the scene and made a few compositions. A shutter speed of 1/3 of a second allowed the falling rain not to register as streaks in the image. Instead, it created a rather ethereal quality of light, with a simplicity that betrayed the occasion. It looked more as if a heavy fog had enveloped the scene, which is often the case in this area in the spring and fall. Quite unexpectedly then, I produced one of my more memorable images under very adverse weather conditions.

The work has also become a statement on the evolution and treatment of these photographs in our society today, and how they now exist as a product of profit and mass consumerism; The original vintage source images were sold to me through an online vendor, and it seems as though being up for sale is the only place they fit in a modern context; Although I have no idea who or where these images originated from, I am giving them a new home in an attempt to honour them as objects that we at times take for granted.",14.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61Fox4oWd4L._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'14', u'11 in.']","Untitled #7,",B00LLPZFEE,11.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

423,mike grandmaison,"'Leaping Arctic Fox' by Mike Grandmaison Churchill, Manitoba. Canada I am almost always delighted to encounter wild creatures, great or small, rare or common. Sharing those exquisite moments when we encounter fellow beings from the animal kingdom in the wild is the reason I photograph wildlife. Photographing animals is no easy feat either. Besides the expensive equipment needed, one requires knowledge of the subject, excellent technique as well as a considerable amount of patience, simply waiting for creatures to show up or to present themselves in a way that creates an interesting image. Far too often, the setting is not ideal, with much clutter surrounding or obscuring the creatures. In fact, much of the wildlife imagery published seldom strays from the documentary world. On this particular occasion, I had traveled to Churchill to photograph polar bears. During our travels in a tundra buggy on the winter trails along the shore of Hudson Bay, someone in our group spotted an arctic fox. In an instant, all eleven of us shifted to one side of the buggy to get a glimpse of the fox. I opted to go outside on the deck at the rear of the buggy where I would mostly likely be alone. It was very cold, with a good wind chill to boot. The fox scurried about through back lit grasses covered in hoarfrost. It was a beautiful sight to behold, the sun having just recently peered though the clouds after nearly six full days of cloudy skies. I observed the fox for a few minutes, holding a 200-400mm Nikkor zoom lens, boosted by a 1.4x teleconverter lens mounted on a D300 Nikon body (the equivalent of an 825mm lens). A tripod was not practical here so I balanced the lens on a bean bag on the ledge of the tundra buggy railing. The fox moved about quickly, looking for prey. Finally, it moved into the light! I anticipated the fox might pounce in the air at some point, as I had observed ...",9.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514qPtVTn6L._QL70_.jpg,200.0,"[u'9', u'14', u'0.1 in.']","'Leaping Arctic Fox' by Mike Grandmaison,",B01E3MT9AW,14.0,126.0,1.5873015873,0.0

In order to investigate these feelings, I began to photograph non-human animals to get to know them as one can only do through rendering them in an artistic medium, using digital imaging software in ways similar to darkroom techniques but with the kind of precise control that makes it possible to treat a photograph almost as if it were a drawing. While I don't interpret in words what I have accomplished in my work, I haven't avoided the words of others on the subject of non-human animals, reading from Darwin to Derrida.

His vision is thoroughly and completely his own, and that his name is not yet enshrined in the pantheon of the other greats is a tragic accident of photographic history, an omission which likely has more to do with his mother's great fame than with a serious consideration of his art. Partridge, born in 1917, was raised in a family of artists, began photographing at fifteen, at seventeen began assisting Dorothea Lange, at nineteen became an assistant to Ansel Adams, and by the age of twenty-three was working as a professional photographer. He has also produced and directed films and been a university lecturer on photography. His work has been the subject of a book, ""Quizzical Eye: The Photography of Rondal Partridge,"" and the film ""Outta My Light!."" His work was included in Edward Steichen's ""Family of Man"" exhibition and has been published in Horizon, Fortune, Harper's Bazaar, Life, Look, and all the major magazines.

While I have embraced digital because of its immediacy and flexibility in processing images, I have also observed that the quality of printing in general has suffered tremendously. 'It's good enough' seems to be the new motto in this digital era. While film was once processed by photo labs and digital scans then tweaked by film production houses, today the responsibility of producing publication quality imagery rests almost entirely on the shoulders of photographers. While almost every person now owns a digital camera, few can actually create great images ready for publication, that realm still being restricted mostly to professional photographers, designers and publishing services. Luckily however, there are still enough discerning clients at the moment that recognize finely crafted images but the reality is that there are fewer and fewer as time passes. While making photographs has always been a passion that has yet to wane, producing the finest quality imagery has always been and always will be my pursuit. 'White Rose' is an example of my commitment to fine printing.

Everyone was told to consider what there was to see, but to limit themselves to only 4-5 shots. This was one of Kertesz'. It is significant in his artistic development in that it sits somewhere between pictorial naturalism and abstract modernism as a transitional work. Of course we know we are looking at an elevated view of a village, although from a rather Chagall-like elevation, but we can't help but see the shapes of the fields and the wine cellars themselves, dissolving into abstract forms.

Interested in the artifacts of our ancestors alongside the products of contemporary culture, I explore with the camera candid moments, gathering information and forms with which I later create abstract compositions. In my post-camera work, through duplication and reorganization of recognizable subjects, decomposing and recomposing architectural elements and objects, I am able to build new forms as well as stretch the limitations of the camera's format in regard to framing and composition. This process allows me to vary perspective, creating spaces with perspectives of their own. In my abstract landscapes, I often use reflected images to reveal layers of depth, color, light and shape as well as the play between positive and negative space, creating penetrable and impenetrable spaces, juxtaposing the aesthetics of the past and the present. It is most often in the urban landscape, where I find an endless palette of shape, texture and color with which to work. I am fascinated by the huge collaborative creative effort that forms the shape of a city, and provides a visual record that is at once historical and current. Through my process, I am able to organize and restructure the bombardment of visual imagery and the dense compression of architecture, design and energy experienced in an urban environment. While photography is traditionally a narrative medium, I ask the viewer to let go of the notion of the photograph as being a picture of some thing and focus instead on the imagery that emerges from recomposed elements.",30.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/610GhhV9zaL._QL70_.jpg,1700.0,"[u'30', u'40 in.']","Berlin Palette 2,",B011AEBZV2,40.0,1200.0,1.41666666667,3.0

Come now, to us, your adherents, who cannot flower from the ice. All the world gleams with the lilies of death the Unconquerable, but come, give us our turn. Enough of the virgins and lilies, of passionate, suffocating perfume of corruption, no more narcissus perfume, lily harlots, the blades of sensation piercing the flesh to blossom of death. Have done, have done with this shuddering, delicious business? of thrilling ruin in the flesh, of pungent passion, of rare, death-edged ecstasy.excerpt from a poem by D.H. Lawrence entitled Craving for Spring This image was made as part of a project I undertook during a fleeting moment between the seasons in the UK. As another hard winter finally begins to creep away, the first shoots begin to appear, moods lighten and the days start to lengthen. I have always been fascinated by the effect that seasons have on our psyches and approaches to life. One aspect of the yearly shift in moods is, for me, held in suspension by a moment before the spring really has a chance to flourish. When the trees develop their blossoms, it ignites something in all of us that allows us to lift the veil of winter and to look toward the coming, warmer seasons with great vivacity. The project was made between London, where I now live and Brighton, where I grew up. It holds a resonance for me with regards to London being the place for new beginnings and the start of a life dedicated to photography. In shooting this project, I was always very aware that I didn't want to over beautify a subject that already has an intrinsic natural beauty. Many of the locations I sourced were on housing estates and in the poorer parts of the two cities. I want to offer the viewer a chance to build their own stories around each location, and how the blossoms relate to that situation.",11.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/610alwFvZnL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'11', u'14 in.']","Untitled #11,",B00LMFSS2E,14.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

503,alma haser,"'Starling' is taken from Haser's project 'Stateless'. For the series, Alma has drawn inspiration from the migration of birds to tell a story of freedom and statelessness. The series was first conceived when Alma reflected on her stepfather's plight to obtain a passport in England. Despite living in the country all his life, he was unable to obtain a passport for years due to an error on his birth certificate. Despite being free, he was somehow in limbo.<br /><br /> In 'Stateless', Alma conveys this story through birds. ""Migratory birds are mostly stateless and therefore free. They are the perfect metaphor for freedom and identity"", says Alma.?The pictures were taken in the Wollaton Hall History Museum in Nottingham, which houses an extensive collection of taxidermy. Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae. Starlings occur naturally in the Old World, from Europe, Asia and Africa, to northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific.<br /><br /> The stuffed birds reflect an ambiguous status: the viewer doesn't quite know whether they are dead or alive, but the birds manage to convey a myriad of feelings regardless: dignity, confusion, sadness, resolution. That is the magic of Alma's 'look'. These fascinating portraits also seem to play with the classic genre of portraiture from the Renaissance and Baroque periods, leveling human beings with animals. Their small format and the posers 'dignified' expressions transport us to a time when having your portrait painted in this fashion was a sign of social success.<br /><br /> For the 'Stateless' series, Alma has worked with Rise Art to create an edition of 50 prints. Each print comes with a signed certificate of authenticity by the artist.",12.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tDQ7k8cjL._QL70_.jpg,140.0,"[u'12.99', u'10.98 in.']","Starling,",B00DWB049G,10.98,142.6302,0.981559305112,0.0

508,mike grandmaison,"'Dance of the Northern Lights' by Mike Grandmaison Matlock, Manitoba. Canada Northern lights or 'aurora borealis' are one of the most awe inspiring phenomenon to witness. I drove up to Matlock, on the western shore of Lake Winnipeg in late afternoon. Things started off very slowly but picked up steam as the evening wore on. A full moon had also begun to rise in the east. As the sky darkened, a faint greenish glow appeared near the horizon. I confirmed the presence of northern lights upon making a long exposure with my digital camera. Long exposures of thirty seconds to two and a half minutes were required to capture enough light to expose the image sufficiently to reduce the problem of image noise. A steady tripod, a cable release and the 'mirror lock up' function on my camera enabled me to capture sharp images at these long exposures. The ISO setting (sensitivity of the sensor) was set between 200 and 800, depending on the intensity of the northern light display. The lens aperture was usually kept wide open but sometime closed a stop or two to allow for more depth of field, especially when photographing close to the pier. The northern lights remained at low levels until around eleven o'clock in the evening after which I was treated to a spectacular display of auroras. I scurried along the beach trying to capture as many different compositions as possible, being acutely aware that northern lights might only last seconds or possibly minutes. The show finally subsided but, shortly after midnight, the northern lights returned and I scurried about some more. The full moon, although bright in the southern sky, did not affect my exposures. The experience was a magical one to say the least. Tired, I packed up around two o'clock in the morning and drove back to Winnipeg about an hour away. Spending the night out in the cold can be a lonely experience, often with little imag...",20.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pzUjS-w-L._QL70_.jpg,1050.0,"[u'20', u'30', u'0.1 in.']","'Dance of the Northern Lights' by Mike Grandmaison,",B01E3MR0YE,30.0,600.0,1.75,2.0

I take two seemingly disparate types of pictures: color images of my surroundings and black-and-white images of window screens.  I photograph my neighborhood, a middle class suburb with woods and the natural world woven throughout it. This is the world I grew up in and a world I am constantly trying to escape.  I then combine these photographs with the screen images. The screens are based on neuroscientist Heinrich Kluver's 'form constants', or patterns that one sees while hallucinating.  I am interested in how screens both admit and deny matter and how, by pushing this even further through digital manipulation, I can use them to alter space and create a new, unsettling environment where barriers begin to break down. I am always struck by the imposing, almost suffocating presence of Southern magnolias.  The one you see here had its branches hung perfectly in a ""v"" form, creating two openings into a sunlit grassy field.  With this photograph, the screen image fit well into the composition of the landscape and allowed me to fracture the space even more.",11.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61L30ig7znL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'11', u'14 in.']","Untitled 2,",B00LLQ1HH2,14.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

537,wendy n. given,"The concept for A. hypogaea albus (Peanut Elves)&originated from a game I was taught as a small child by my mother and grandparents which involved searching for elves inside of raw peanuts. The true origin of the game is unknown, although, it traditionally passed through several generations of my maternal family in the Netherlands as a pastime of discovery, patience, and imagination. In order to produce the peanut elves, I sorted through hundreds of peanut halves to discover specimens that contained a recognizable elf ""face"" in the seedpod when viewed with the naked eye. Then, I very minimally and carefully carved each seedpod to enhance the preexisting prominent features of each peanut elf. With focused lighting, careful placement of shadows, and the use of a macro lens, each peanut assumes a distinctive identity with elvish features. By enlarging the peanut elves approximately thirty times the actual size, the complexity, realism and detail of the individual elves are readily accessible to the viewer. The outcome of the project initiates the viewer into a renewed awareness and piqued interest in discovering, or rediscovering, the typically unseen realm of our existence. Magic, nature, folklore and the various processes of human awareness and perception are all subjects that greatly interest me. As a result of these interests, I have considerably directed the focus of my work over the past five years towards investigating the extraordinary and otherworldly occurrent findings hidden within the natural world.I am also very interested in inattentional blindness, also known as perceptual blindness, which is the phenomenon of not being able to see things that are actually there. This can be a result of having no internal frame of reference to perceive the unseen objects, or it can be the result of the mental focus or attention which causes mental distractions.",14.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31-W3jGLx4L._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'14', u'11 in.']","A.

The striped pattern is produced by masks placed in-camera, this feature allows me to blend two images together and at the same time keeps them from fully fusing onto one another. After capturing the first shot I go in search of its partner. Whether found, hunted or staged the second exposure must meet the prerequisites set by the first in order to create a successful pairing; a bit like matchmaking I guess. Part of my process is to write down the f-stop and speed value of each shot, and draw a diagram of its framing and composition. These notes direct me in the search for that second exposure. In The Weekend #6 we see a figure on a bench in a park. Aligned with it is a brick building with many windows. I particularly like the interaction between horizontal and vertical lines in this image.

541,alma haser,"'Fieldfare' is taken from Haser's project 'Stateless'. For the series, Alma has drawn inspiration from the migration of birds to tell a story of freedom and statelessness. The series was first conceived when Alma reflected on her stepfather's plight to obtain a passport in England. Despite living in the country all his life, he was unable to obtain a passport for years due to an error on his birth certificate. Despite being free, he was somehow in limbo.<br /><br /> In 'Stateless', Alma conveys this story through birds. ""Migratory birds are mostly stateless and therefore free. They are the perfect metaphor for freedom and identity"", says Alma.?The pictures were taken in the Wollaton Hall History Museum in Nottingham, which houses an extensive collection of taxidermy. The Fieldfare is a member of the thrush family Turdidae. It breeds in woodland and scrub in northern Europe and Asia. It is strongly migratory, with many northern birds moving south during the winter, and a very rare breeder in Great Britain and Ireland.<br /><br /> The stuffed birds reflect an ambiguous status: the viewer doesn't quite know whether they are dead or alive, but the birds manage to convey a myriad of feelings regardless: dignity, confusion, sadness, resolution. That is the magic of Alma's 'look'. These fascinating portraits also seem to play with the classic genre of portraiture from the Renaissance and Baroque periods, leveling human beings with animals. Their small format and the posers 'dignified' expressions transport us to a time when having your portrait painted in this fashion was a sign of social success.<br /><br /> For the 'Stateless' series, Alma has worked with Rise Art to create an edition of 50 prints. Each print comes with a signed certificate of authenticity by the artist.",12.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LRYGqyrvL._QL70_.jpg,140.0,"[u'12.99', u'10.98 in.']","Fieldfare,",B00DWB06R6,10.98,142.6302,0.981559305112,0.0

However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.). Uniforms, and outfits in general, send social signals that usually indicate personal and cultural identity. The idea of dress code works on many levels and is defined in many ways.

His great grandfather and great uncle, in providing for their families and future, fell many of the actual trees whose remnants you now see in these photographs.

My original intent was to bake 30 birthday cakes for myself and photograph them. I didn't quite make it to 30 cakes in time for my first show. I ordered a cake decorating kit from Marthastewart.com and watched the instructional video that came with the package. I quickly discovered my cakes were never going to look like the ones in the video and the pamphlet, and I was free to make them as grotesque and amazing as possible - my little rebellion. Do-it-yourself divas on television and in magazines live in a fantasy world where entertaining, cooking and decorating unite in a beautiful home, decorated seasonally, in order to entertain friends with gourmet meals and elaborately concocted desserts.

627,michael cardinali,"The Bussey Brook Meadow rests on the outskirts of the Arnold Arboretum in Boston. I'm frequently attracted to this swampy, less groomed area outside the stone walls and across a highway from the main gardens. What it lacks in manicure and formal structure, it more than makes up for in the kind of energetic impulse lowland swamps have with abrupt flooding, fast growth and dazzling seasonal changes. For me, this crabapple feels like an explosion, a surprise of yellow juxtaposed against the brown fall colours. The everyday wilds encountered by a city dweller often amount to a space shaped at least as much by hands as by natures impulses. The Emerald Necklace is one of the countrys oldest series of parklands. It exists as a chain of parkways and waterways stretching 1,100 acres from the hub of Boston's Back Bay to the outlying neighborhoods of Roslindale and Roxbury. Its history reveals a visionary creation, overdevelopment, neglect, and renewed efforts at restoration and maintenance. Moving to Boston four years ago from New York City, I was intrigued by this incongruous swamp with a city growing out of it. Passing through an eclectic commingling of roads and traffic, community gardens, birds and mud, I eventually arrived at the Arnold Arboretum. At the southern end of the Emerald Necklace, this 265-acre tract of land is home to the most diverse collection of trees in the United States. It is the countrys oldest public arboretum, the garden of gardens. Over the past two years, I have been photographing this area with a large-format camera. I am continually struck by how this land is brought to a kind of order through a combination of rivers and plumbing, hills and stonewalls, mulched footpaths and untameble lowland swamps. It's a complicated place where order and unencumbered growth exist atop one another, reflecting the way we live in a dance between different, if not entirely opposite forces.",11.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61bN2HJ2xRL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'11', u'14 in.']","Fruit Tree, Bussey Brook Meadow,",B00LMFQJFC,14.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only.

She would nonchalantly raise the just lit and perfectly rolled cigarette to her lips, fashionable nail polish glinting in the afternoon sun. And as I say this, I raise the camera to my mind's eye, and there I am with her in that secluded space where all of me is gathered, poised to act, to press the button. I look, I see, the shutter clicks. It all started as a child, much before I had a camera. Now I have one; and when I look at my own images, I discern a quest for harmony, for beauty and for peacefulness. As a man who lives through his eyes, this yearning, this insistence is always with me. I like working outdoors. Light, air and space are oxygen to me; and in general my images reflect that as they tend to be simple and direct- simpy look and you can see. In my world, pictures are about subtle transfers of energy; tiny realignments, really- no drama, no upheavels. These for me are true moments. And for all that I am deeply grateful to Paul Strand, Edward Steichen, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Andre Kertesz, Irving Penn and a multitude of others for teaching me to look at things simply and directly- for the rest truly happens on its own and over time. I am also grateful to and fascinated by the work of photographers like Bill Brandt for showing me that things and people will conform to how we choose to represent them; a reminder that each of us is often the creator of realities that are not just deeply personal but squarely beyond what is commonly known and accepted as the everyday experience.

660,angus rowe macpherson,"I explore banal and mundane activities - mowing lawns, serving dinner, fishing - using highly cinematic methods. Each individual image is meticulously composed, elevating ordinary subjects into iconic status. These are deliberate and artificially elaborate  environments - the characters are carefully cast, stylized and lit, and the landscape around them is carefully constructed (you'll see fog machines, elaborate sets and props, and at least one fake ham). The resulting scene is from an alternate universe. It is very similar to ours, but slightly surreal, grotesque, beautiful and darkly funny. The characters communicate very real emotions; they are variously obsessed, isolated, frantic, preening, proud, confused, and desperate for acceptance. Fising is part of a larger series I've been working on of preposterously iconic images of people doing mundane things.  Both of these photographs - Huntingand Fishing - were shot on a farm about 150 km north of Toronto, on an alarmingly cold day in May. It actually snowed while we were shooting, which was especially fun when I was waist deep in pond water.  However, it did lend a certain sense of stillness to the set.  That, along with the fog machines operated by my assistants, cemented the atmosphere of the iconic great outdoors.",11.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lgY1saHGL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'11', u'14 in.']","Fishing,",B00LLQ04DU,14.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

This trend is especially significant to Taiwan, which was under Japanese rule from 1895 and 1945 and where Ting-Ting was born and raised.",15.75,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oMNFc2ihL._QL70_.jpg,850.0,"[u'15.75', u'19.69 in.']","Still Life with Louis Vuitton Banana,",B00DWB63M8,19.69,310.1175,2.74089659565,2.0
662,joseph shields,"Archival Ink Jet Print. Signed Limited Edition #1 of 10. Printed on museum quality paper with torn edges and floated in 24"" x 24"" off white mat. Paper size is @ 18"" x 18"". ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world. Thanks so much for your interest in my work.

663,alma haser,"I have always made things with my hands and I've now tried to find a way to combine my fine art background with photography. I've used origami in the past as props in my photographs, but in this series Cosmic Surgery the origami has become an integral part of the final image. The series has three distinct stages. Firstly I photograph my sitter, then print multiple images of the subjects face and fold them into a complicated origami modular construction, which then gets placed back onto the original face of the portrait. Finally the whole thing is re-photographed. Origami is very meditative, you can get lost in the world of folding for hours. It is also extremely delicate and fragile, so by giving each geometric paper shape somewhere to sit within the final image, the origami has been given a backbone. There is something quite alien about the manipulated faces, as if they belong to some futuristic next generation. In these portraits the children become uncanny, while their parents are seen in a more familiar moment. With the simple act of folding an image I can transform each face and make a sort of flattened sculpture. By de-facing my models I have made their portraits into my own creations.",20.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lTJvfmaCL._QL70_.jpg,250.0,"[u'20', u'16 in.']","Hassan,",B00UB3TJYY,16.0,320.0,0.78125,0.0

No doubt when the collecting public realizes this, there will be a major ""correction"" in Siskind prices.

Chong began this series in 2005. Chong's oeuvre is the Freudian notion of Death - a 'dear of extinction'. The images address this in-between state, portraying the pain that lingers not with a place itself but with the things left by human beings at a particular place. In the artist's words, ""the unbearable traumatic feeling in us wanting to know what will happen next after knowing what has happened."" Chong's practice revolves around the idea of fragility, of human life within the rapid flux of a city, and of built structure within an increasingly unpredictable natural environment. In viewing the works, the audience is confronted simultaneously with the remnants of the past, the emptiness of the present and the uncertainty of the future. By carefully interweaving notions of memory, place and identity, Chong constructs scenarios that hinge on the boundary of fiction and reality to play on the psychology of life and death.",39.96,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510EQLc81ZL._QL70_.jpg,3250.0,"[u'39.96', u'31.5 in.']","Untitled #36,",B013140308,31.5,1258.74,2.58194702639,3.0

Recently, I have been working with India ink applied to translucent drafting film, which is hung and backlit for photographing. I shoot with an 8x10 camera and print in a traditional color darkroom. The subject matter is not a construct of previously sketched and carefully rendered images. It is rather a documentation of collaborative happenstance with material and mark, and with the catalytic ability for photography to shift this literal matter into potential notions of reference. Photographs now seem as abundant as words, taken in as a grammar or code. My work has become a sort of code, or formal system in my mind: reducing infinite subject-hood to simple planes of matter to be photographed and perceived. I am intrigued by the impulse to comprehend and read this language, and am informed by the context and image body we bring with us to any one photographic object or lens based gesture. Considering all we bring, I tend to eliminate much, reducing the photogenic possibilities down to a blank sheet of drafting film, ink, and a discipline with analog photography. From this place of uncertainty comes some sort of measurable mark. The camera takes it, and we take the image. For my thinking, the process is no longer about specific idea or creative gesture, but about certain distances of form and media yielding to potential.",10.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Z7ZUmd5jL._QL70_.jpg,2000.0,"[u'10', u'25 in.']","[photograph] 20 Feb 2013 (Triptych),",B00PM14I46,25.0,250.0,8.0,3.0

I am living in a little borough outside of Reading with my partner, our dog and 3 cats. We are enjoying having space, a backyard and are reminded daily of our surroundings looking out the window. These images were inspired by the seasons and the new landscape. The Confections Series began as a response to turning 30. It was a celebration of birthdays, color, pattern and obsessive absurdity. My original idea was to bake 30 birthday cakes for myself and photograph them. I didn't quite make it to 30 cakes in time for my first show, but I sure got a lot of ideas from those first cakes. I ordered a kit from Martha Stewart.com and watched an instructional video on decorating cakes;When I quickly discovered my cakes were never going to look like the ones in the video and the pamphlet, I decided they were better off in their exuberantly imperfect states.",11.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fSj0mT2lL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'11', u'14 in.']","Confections (adorned) #23,",B00LLQ18LC,14.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

768,angus rowe macpherson,"I explore banal and mundane activities - mowing lawns, serving dinner, fishing - using highly cinematic methods. Each individual image is meticulously composed, elevating ordinary subjects into iconic status. These are deliberate and artificially elaborate  environments - the characters are carefully cast, stylized and lit, and the landscape around them is carefully constructed (you'll see fog machines, elaborate sets and props, and at least one fake ham). The resulting scene is from an alternate universe. It is very similar to ours, but slightly surreal, grotesque, beautiful and darkly funny. The characters communicate very real emotions; they are variously obsessed, isolated, frantic, preening, proud, confused, and desperate for acceptance. Fising is part of a larger series I've been working on of preposterously iconic images of people doing mundane things.  Both of these photographs - Huntingand Fishing - were shot on a farm about 150 km north of Toronto, on an alarmingly cold day in May. It actually snowed while we were shooting, which was especially fun when I was waist deep in pond water.  However, it did lend a certain sense of stillness to the set.  That, along with the fog machines operated by my assistants, cemented the atmosphere of the iconic great outdoors.",11.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MFXEHgzaL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'11', u'14 in.']","Hunting,",B00LLQ09S0,14.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

Since that first journey, I typically spend three months each year in the north with a bush pilot in a two-seat airplane built in 1946. We set off in the autumn, at the end of the pilot's season, when we have the skies to ourselves. In the beginning I was drawn to the boom and bust resource towns scattered throughout northern Canada. I wanted to know what happened in these places: what the people were like and what it felt like to be in a place that is surrounded by so much uninhabited, wild land. It would sometimes take weeks to make our way to these remote villages. Along the way we camped in wilderness, took shelter in fire towers, and were often taken in by strangers. When we finally arrived in an isolated community we would often get stuck waiting for the weather to change, or a shipment of fuel to arrive, or parts for the plane. Most of these communities had no access roads and had generally experienced reckless growth or stagnation, and then decline. The surrounding wilderness has a deep effect on the inhabitants of these towns and, in turn, the towns have a great impact on the wilderness. And in these small isolated communities, it is possible to see clearly how individuals have made each community vastly different. I have become increasingly captivated by the wilderness between lonely settlements. Vast areas of land not yet exploited, or briefly plundered and left uninhabited. Growing up in western Canada on the edge of the boreal forest, I had vague impressions of mysterious and wild, yet monotonous places. I thought of the north as an endless expanse of homogeneous forests, lakes and tundra. I was wrong. I have been astonished by the variety and complexity of these landscapes. These photographs show a wilderness of increasing importance to the world, on the cusp of great change.",11.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Yui2gG8GL._QL70_.jpg,250.0,"[u'11', u'14 in.']","Rain Cloud, Lake Athabasca,",B00LMFO3P0,14.0,154.0,1.62337662338,0.0

Together these pictures show different ways of being a part of something as well as representing communities in their transitional states.

A landscape which once contained dens made in hedgerows, nature to discover, a thousand places to explore with the innocent wonder of childhood. These areas are etched into my memory, yet made strange by the darkness of night - a strangeness that resonates with change as I become increasingly distant from this rural landscape. Artificial lights punctuate the darkness of the landscape, imitating the natural glow of the sun during daytime, creating the atmosphere of a never-ending day. This light pollution affects the natural order of things, causing birds to sing and flowers to bloom in the middle of the night. Animals remain awake. The lights produce a gravitational effect on insects, drawing them in towards the glow. This gravitational pull created by light, also seems to influence people as they surround their homes with security lights and live in an artificially 'safe' atmosphere. The light creates a barrier, both actual and metaphorical, separating people from the natural environment of the countryside. This light pollution prevents people from viewing the stars, which were once used both as a method of navigation and planning the future. Navigation is now done through the bright screens of satellite navigation systems, and by following lit-up road signs along safely illuminated, glowing roads. We have moved away from our relationship with the natural environment.

The fish are male guppies (Poecilia reticulata), also known as the millionfish; Freshwater fish are significant in the Buddhist religion and I saw many of them in or around homes and temples in South East Asia, and for sale in specialty fish shops and markets.

It didn't speak to the beauty, or the splendor of the rivers passage, but to me, seemed rather to speak about isolation, fear and power. These images were taken as part of the series This Land. In this body of work, I explore the vast geography of the American west, attempting to interpret the spaces and landscapes.

Two distinct environmental regions - a central semi-tropical forest, ringed by pale white sand dunes dotted with geothermal oddities like the extraordinary Black Geyser - harbor some six hundred species of fauna, roughly seventy percent of which exist only on the island. From curiosities such as the ghost hare (a black and white animal that seems to share a genetic background with extinct species of both hounds and hares) to spiny burrowing anteaters, brightly colored dune-dwelling rock pheasants, and improbably oversized felines such as the heavy oncela and the iriamondi cat, Pulau Pejantan provides scientists with an extraordinary opportunity to study what is essentially a closed ecological system. Conditions are difficult for observation on the remote island. Its peculiar hydrological activity and location in the doldrums of the equatorial region along the Java trench combine to produce a thick blanket of fog that covers its landmass essentially from sunrise to late afternoon, 365 days a year; as a result, much of the work must be done in poor light.

It was a beautiful summer evening; I was cruising down the Oregon Coast when I came along a very unique setting. The tide was rolling over rocks a few hundred yards out into the ocean, and the sun was soon to set directly behind. The situation was very risky, but I knew it would be worth it. I gathered my gear, and set out, jumping from rock to rock to get as close as possible. With a nice shake in the leg, I made it. The swell was much bigger than it looked from shore. The waves were coming in overhead and breaking within feet of where I was standing. Fortunately the rocks dissolved the waves, and acted as a barrier, allowing me to stand there. Every few waves would come over and get me, making my legs shake. As I scrambled to set up my equipment, the sun was dropping behind the clouds. The magic then happened. The sky lit up with beautiful pinks, purples and oranges, as the water poured over the rocks right beneath me. As I hit the shutter, my thoughts were confirmed. The risk paid off!

I took my camera and walked down the mesmerizing hallway of trees. I was completely surrounded by beauty. I felt I was in a dream world, so unique in color and perfection.

You hike into a massive gorge with a hundred footwalls on either side of you. You quickly come upon a massive log dam that is extremely slippery making it quite dangerous to get over. Past the log dam, you see a river running through the walls of the gorge, winding down and around for as far as you can see. The only way to go is through the bitter cold water. As you continue on, the walls narrow to arms length and the water rises until you are chest deep in freezing cold water. Outside of the log dam and the extreme water temperatures you have to maneuver through loads of people. Oneonta Gorge has always been a place many frequent, and its sheer beauty explains why. As a landscape photographer, the goal is to steer clear of the people! This is hard here! On this day, I had hiked over the log dam, through the water, past a few dozen people to finally make it to the end, where a picturesque waterfall pours nearly 100 feet into the gorge. I pulled out my camera, set up and took a second to take in the scene. It was at that point where I finally had been all by myself. Just the waterfall and I!

When a waterfall decides to make its way through these lush landscapes, a scene is created that will stop you in your tracks and leave you speechless. This particular waterfall in Oregon was a priority on my list for a long time. The day had finally come, and my wife and I set out to enjoy its beauty. We drove for a few hours, only to be stopped by a road closure sign with a gate. A bit disappointed to be stuck after having our hopes high, we quickly realized we had brought two bicycles with us. We pulled over, gathered our equipment and set out up a steep highway. After a tough few miles we made it to the trailhead. A few miles of hiking into the forest and sure enough, there we were, stopped in our tracks, left speechless. Just as imagined, the water was falling down a rock face covered in moss, trickling through the rocks and falling trees and passing our feet.

Few minutes into the drive, I glanced to my left and saw a scene that intrigued me. I quickly put my coffee down, slammed on the breaks and grabbed my camera, leaving my truck in the middle of the road. The scene was as eerie as it was beautiful. I was standing on a bridge, looking down a mist covered, perfectly calm river. The trees hung over the river, as if they were thirsty, and needed a drink. They reflected off the river perfectly. It was just about fall and a few leaves had started to change, giving a nice stand out orange accent. It was a scene that you could stare at for a while, just trying to figure out how you felt.

All the trees, placed so carefully between buildings, the flora that frames city doorways, the flowers that line the sidewalk. In the city, we control nature. We shape it. Or try to. When I moved to Savannah, Georgia in 2001, I saw an evolution taking place in the city, one that has been ongoing for nearly three centuries. The city was designed to fuse the natural and urban environments. That has worked to the city's advantage, creating a unique, even eccentric, reality. But Savannah is in constant metamorphosis, with endless construction shaping and reshaping its streets. After the sun fades away, so does the city's congestion. This is when people retire to their homes and hotels for the night and the city puts itself on display. With the moon and artificial light working together, Savannah is illuminated by both nature and man. Those scenes afford a real solitude that's witnessed by the lucky few. That's the Savannah I know &ndash; that world where nature and the city connect, in the quiet glow of night.

Seventy percent of my time during this 4-week stay went into producing source materials, which I could later use to re-work into compositions for these reconstructed landscapes. I was thrilled to work with film again, and to re-introduce myself to colour printing darkrooms, which I haven't had access to for over 8 years; Working with the ability to produce many prints in a short period of time with a broad spectrum of results gave my work a looseness, spontaneity and playfulness, which I had been craving. These photographs are two of my favorites from this ongoing series; Broken Horizons Using the manipulation of photographic raw materials, Comber physically rearranges imagery to create new visual constructions of her surroundings. Working with these physical documents gives her a flexible medium with which to explore notions such as the landscape and our place amongst it, the mental construction of our reality and the artificiality of media, while also using the re-ordering of her environment as a meditation on existence itself; Her experiences and reflections are documented, printed and then re-photographed into new compositions to address themes such as the raw and immense power of the wilderness, the environments we inhabit, and the physical world that connects and surrounds us; The act of interpreting space allows Comber's aesthetic to unravel like a mysterious new dimension where the landscape acts out of the binds of reality; This exploration has resulted in images charged with the physical tension of constructed hand cut edges uniting a collision of mismatched visual fields.",14.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511xsXJ72eL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'14', u'11 in.']","Sky Edge,",B00LMGIOOA,11.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

That ghost represented a grimness of the future; it was haunting, the way the sound of clinking chains echoed, calling us to the dread from which it came.

The striped pattern is produced by masks placed in-camera, this feature allows me to blend two images together and at the same time keeps them from fully fusing onto one another. After capturing the first shot I go in search of its partner. Whether found, hunted or staged the second exposure must meet the prerequisites set by the first in order to create a successful pairing; a bit like matchmaking I guess. Part of my process is to write down the f-stop and speed value of each shot, and draw a diagram of its framing and composition. These notes direct me in the search for that second exposure. In The Weekend #6 we see a figure on a bench in a park. Aligned with it is a brick building with many windows. I particularly like the interaction between horizontal and vertical lines in this image.

I traveled to stations I rarely visited, and when I pulled into this station, it immediately struck me as an interesting clash of lines and outlandish bench designs. The almost throne-like appearance of the bench is in immediate competition with the strong horizontal lines of the bricks behind it as well as the diamond-tiles of the floor. Opened in 1988, it's a testament to the &ldquo;over-design&rdquo; of the 1980s and would undoubtedly never be designed like this today.

The &lsquo;Dead Supermarket Flowers' series is a response to the tension between the beauty and banality of these everyday purchases. The advertisements and imagery at the point of sale describe nature, freshness delivered to you in crisp cellophane, with a guaranteed lifetime.

If my camera is conspicuous, spontaneity is lost and the image becomes crafted. Instead I stand waiting for the genius in them that shows me that essence of innocence. I am collecting flashes of vulnerability that reveal in us a relation to a child who, unknowingly, understands all we seek to discover. I ask of them only to be children. Living in Los Angeles has imbued in me the idea that every patch of sunlight can be a stage.

Nearly twenty years had passed since I had last visited this place, and I struggled to remember anything about it. It's funny how photographs help us build our idea of the past. All the memories I have about these holidays are based on family snapshots taken by my father and the stories he told me. Being confronted with that landscape again made me realize how little I actually remembered about that time. As if it was the first time I had ever visited, as if I had never been a child at all. It was then when I started to shoot this series. I felt the need to record the past in my own way, providing it with my own version of its true appearance. But this quickly turned into an impossible mission. While these spaces had remained nearly unaltered, it was me who, for some reason, decided to depict them as threatening scenarios. And then I knew.

The air is thick with moisture, blues and pinks shine through ambient light, creating an other worldly experience and reflecting the implied isolation of the viewer;These photographs are a result of wanderings through and around my Boston neighborhood at night, while neighbors go about their interior, hidden lives, the only evidence of which is through their illuminated windows.",14.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gQ2s%2BsazL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'14', u'11 in.']","Untitled #228,",B00LLPY6MG,11.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0
1126,sarah mangialardo,"This image was made in the ravine that surrounds the house I grew up in, a house that my mother still lives in. At the time of creating the image I was on a visit to Toronto from Montreal where I was in the process of completing my MFA. A lot of my work up to this point had been circling around ideas of childhood and narrative, but having the opportunity to work in and around my childhood home really influenced and pushed this work towards issues of nostalgia and familial relations. Here I was traipsing through the same ravine that had been my childhood stomping ground, trying to make images that spoke to larger issues, and all I kept thinking about was that these were the same trees, the same dips and stumps, the same winding paths that I had spent so much of my own childhood amongst. In the end, the process of making this image became a very strange and wonderful experience where time and space collapsed and expanded over and over again for me, as I attempted to turn a place with such meaningful memories into a canvas on which to make work.",14.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61VA9%2BnkQHL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'14', u'11 in.']","Untitled,",B00LLQ5T0S,11.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0
1127,sarah mangialardo,"This image was made in my little one room apartment in downtown Montreal. I was in the first year of my MFA and was still trying to adjust to a new city where I didn't have many close friends. I started writing short stories as a release from the boredom and this image came from one of those stories. In fact, this image is more of an installment in a larger batch of images that tell the story of a girl's struggle to adulthood in a world where magic and violence, as well as hope and trauma, exist simultaneously. I am really interested in the relationship between storytelling and photography, as well as the ability of photographic images to exist so tenuously between the realms of the real and the imagined. As such, I tend to build my images with metaphorical signs that alone don't mean that much, but together can open an image to a range of readings and narratives. This building of meaning is also a way for me to create images that are seemingly amiable at first glance, but after closer inspection begin to reveal hints of something darker looming just beneath the surface.",14.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BY3eD2JRL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'14', u'11 in.']","Untitled,",B00LLQ5J9O,11.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

I hoped to draw a stark contrast with our normal daylight perceptions of a city that, being London, is usually dull, grey and thronging with people. At night, I imagined it as an empty stage, spotlit from multiple angles with different light sources casting garish hues. In this de-peopled twilight zone, I found the buildings and infrastructure seemed isolated from their purpose of serving humanity's needs, thus exposing their ""genius or folly, beauty or ugliness"". I wanted to reveal one of the busiest cities in the world, that was undergoing an Olympic building boom at the time, that is never more than a few hours from complete stillness. This selection of shots were all taken under ground, in tunnels or under bridges. I'd photographed this exact view about three years previously, for a project on derelict buildings called Left London. I popped back after finding myself in the same neighbourhood again, and was amazed at the changes taking place - as an Olympic venue rose up on the other side of the canal. In the shot, I was trying to capture the otherworldly glare of the security lights in an otherwise nondescript location.",14.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YpHb2IEkL._QL70_.jpg,100.0,"[u'14', u'11 in.']","Bridge Over Canal, E15,",B00LLQANOA,11.0,154.0,0.649350649351,0.0

They've called my name for quite some time now and my day had finally come. I was in Page, Arizona with my wife. Shortly after sunset we decided to set out for the trailhead to find the infamous rock formations. A calm drive through the desert turned chaotic quickly as a thunderstorm swept in. We were off road in feet of mud for a good two hours. It was about midnight when we finally made it to the trailhead. We spent the night in a fellow traveler's van, a true blessing to have shelter from the storm. Our alarms sounded at 5 am and we work to realize that the storm had not yet passed and we were stuck. We waited it out. As 9am rolled around, the weather broke, the sun came out and we knew it was our time to make a move! We set out on foot and two hours later we came upon our destination. The rock formations were nothing short of what we expected. They were magnificent. I came across a pool of rainwater from the storm, with the rock reflecting perfectly in it. The sight stopped me in my tracks. As I set up my camera to take the shot, I paused, remembering all that went into this adventure.

I gathered my gear, and set out, jumping from rock to rock to get as close as possible. With a nice shake in the leg, I made it. The swell was much bigger than it looked from shore. The waves were coming in overhead and breaking within feet of where I was standing. Fortunately the rocks dissolved the waves, and acted as a barrier, allowing me to stand there. Every few waves would come over and get me, making my legs shake. As I scrambled to set up my equipment, the sun was dropping behind the clouds. The magic then happened.

1309,amy finkelstein,"My work process involves photographing fields of matter and discovering what these fields, within the structure of this media, can potentially yield. Recently, I have been working with India ink applied to translucent drafting film, which is hung and backlit for photographing. I shoot with an 8x10 camera and print in a traditional color darkroom. The subject matter is not a construct of previously sketched and carefully rendered images. It is rather a documentation of collaborative happenstance with material and mark, and with the catalytic ability for photography to shift this literal matter into potential notions of reference. Photographs now seem as abundant as words, taken in as a grammar or code. My work has become a sort of code, or formal system in my mind: reducing infinite subject-hood to simple planes of matter to be photographed and perceived. I am intrigued by the impulse to comprehend and read this language, and am informed by the context and image body we bring with us to any one photographic object or lens based gesture. Considering all we bring, I tend to eliminate much, reducing the photogenic possibilities down to a blank sheet of drafting film, ink, and a discipline with analog photography.

It was a beautiful summer evening; I was cruising down the Oregon Coast when I came along a very unique setting. The tide was rolling over rocks a few hundred yards out into the ocean, and the sun was soon to set directly behind. The situation was very risky, but I knew it would be worth it. I gathered my gear, and set out, jumping from rock to rock to get as close as possible. With a nice shake in the leg, I made it. The swell was much bigger than it looked from shore. The waves were coming in overhead and breaking within feet of where I was standing. Fortunately the rocks dissolved the waves, and acted as a barrier, allowing me to stand there. Every few waves would come over and get me, making my legs shake. As I scrambled to set up my equipment, the sun was dropping behind the clouds. The magic then happened. The sky lit up with beautiful pinks, purples and oranges, as the water poured over the rocks right beneath me. As I hit the shutter, my thoughts were confirmed. The risk paid off!

They've called my name for quite some time now and my day had finally come. I was in Page, Arizona with my wife. Shortly after sunset we decided to set out for the trailhead to find the infamous rock formations. A calm drive through the desert turned chaotic quickly as a thunderstorm swept in. We were off road in feet of mud for a good two hours. It was about midnight when we finally made it to the trailhead. We spent the night in a fellow traveler's van, a true blessing to have shelter from the storm. Our alarms sounded at 5 am and we work to realize that the storm had not yet passed and we were stuck. We waited it out. As 9am rolled around, the weather broke, the sun came out and we knew it was our time to make a move! We set out on foot and two hours later we came upon our destination. The rock formations were nothing short of what we expected. They were magnificent. I came across a pool of rainwater from the storm, with the rock reflecting perfectly in it. The sight stopped me in my tracks. As I set up my camera to take the shot, I paused, remembering all that went into this adventure.

1407,ross lipson,"I've been to the Oneonta Gorge in Oregon over a dozen times. The place is unlike anywhere else I've been. You hike into a massive gorge with a hundred footwalls on either side of you. You quickly come upon a massive log dam that is extremely slippery making it quite dangerous to get over. Past the log dam, you see a river running through the walls of the gorge, winding down and around for as far as you can see. The only way to go is through the bitter cold water. As you continue on, the walls narrow to arms length and the water rises until you are chest deep in freezing cold water. Outside of the log dam and the extreme water temperatures you have to maneuver through loads of people. Oneonta Gorge has always been a place many frequent, and its sheer beauty explains why. As a landscape photographer, the goal is to steer clear of the people! This is hard here! On this day, I had hiked over the log dam, through the water, past a few dozen people to finally make it to the end, where a picturesque waterfall pours nearly 100 feet into the gorge. I pulled out my camera, set up and took a second to take in the scene. It was at that point where I finally had been all by myself. Just the waterfall and I!

When a waterfall decides to make its way through these lush landscapes, a scene is created that will stop you in your tracks and leave you speechless. This particular waterfall in Oregon was a priority on my list for a long time. The day had finally come, and my wife and I set out to enjoy its beauty. We drove for a few hours, only to be stopped by a road closure sign with a gate. A bit disappointed to be stuck after having our hopes high, we quickly realized we had brought two bicycles with us. We pulled over, gathered our equipment and set out up a steep highway. After a tough few miles we made it to the trailhead. A few miles of hiking into the forest and sure enough, there we were, stopped in our tracks, left speechless.

It was a beautiful summer evening; I was cruising down the Oregon Coast when I came along a very unique setting. The tide was rolling over rocks a few hundred yards out into the ocean, and the sun was soon to set directly behind. The situation was very risky, but I knew it would be worth it. I gathered my gear, and set out, jumping from rock to rock to get as close as possible. With a nice shake in the leg, I made it. The swell was much bigger than it looked from shore. The waves were coming in overhead and breaking within feet of where I was standing. Fortunately the rocks dissolved the waves, and acted as a barrier, allowing me to stand there. Every few waves would come over and get me, making my legs shake. As I scrambled to set up my equipment, the sun was dropping behind the clouds. The magic then happened. The sky lit up with beautiful pinks, purples and oranges, as the water poured over the rocks right beneath me. As I hit the shutter, my thoughts were confirmed. The risk paid off!

They've called my name for quite some time now and my day had finally come. I was in Page, Arizona with my wife. Shortly after sunset we decided to set out for the trailhead to find the infamous rock formations. A calm drive through the desert turned chaotic quickly as a thunderstorm swept in. We were off road in feet of mud for a good two hours. It was about midnight when we finally made it to the trailhead. We spent the night in a fellow traveler's van, a true blessing to have shelter from the storm. Our alarms sounded at 5 am and we work to realize that the storm had not yet passed and we were stuck. We waited it out. As 9am rolled around, the weather broke, the sun came out and we knew it was our time to make a move! We set out on foot and two hours later we came upon our destination. The rock formations were nothing short of what we expected. They were magnificent. I came across a pool of rainwater from the storm, with the rock reflecting perfectly in it. The sight stopped me in my tracks. As I set up my camera to take the shot, I paused, remembering all that went into this adventure.

When a waterfall decides to make its way through these lush landscapes, a scene is created that will stop you in your tracks and leave you speechless. This particular waterfall in Oregon was a priority on my list for a long time. The day had finally come, and my wife and I set out to enjoy its beauty. We drove for a few hours, only to be stopped by a road closure sign with a gate. A bit disappointed to be stuck after having our hopes high, we quickly realized we had brought two bicycles with us. We pulled over, gathered our equipment and set out up a steep highway. After a tough few miles we made it to the trailhead. A few miles of hiking into the forest and sure enough, there we were, stopped in our tracks, left speechless.

It was a beautiful summer evening; I was cruising down the Oregon Coast when I came along a very unique setting. The tide was rolling over rocks a few hundred yards out into the ocean, and the sun was soon to set directly behind. The situation was very risky, but I knew it would be worth it. I gathered my gear, and set out, jumping from rock to rock to get as close as possible. With a nice shake in the leg, I made it. The swell was much bigger than it looked from shore. The waves were coming in overhead and breaking within feet of where I was standing. Fortunately the rocks dissolved the waves, and acted as a barrier, allowing me to stand there. Every few waves would come over and get me, making my legs shake. As I scrambled to set up my equipment, the sun was dropping behind the clouds. The magic then happened. The sky lit up with beautiful pinks, purples and oranges, as the water poured over the rocks right beneath me. As I hit the shutter, my thoughts were confirmed. The risk paid off! It was unquestionably A Beautiful Risk.",20.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uUhRDUVIL._QL70_.jpg,505.0,"[u'20', u'30 in.']","20x30 in.

They've called my name for quite some time now and my day had finally come. I was in Page, Arizona with my wife. Shortly after sunset we decided to set out for the trailhead to find the infamous rock formations. A calm drive through the desert turned chaotic quickly as a thunderstorm swept in. We were off road in feet of mud for a good two hours. It was about midnight when we finally made it to the trailhead. We spent the night in a fellow traveler's van, a true blessing to have shelter from the storm. Our alarms sounded at 5 am and we work to realize that the storm had not yet passed and we were stuck. We waited it out. As 9am rolled around, the weather broke, the sun came out and we knew it was our time to make a move! We set out on foot and two hours later we came upon our destination. The rock formations were nothing short of what we expected. They were magnificent. I came across a pool of rainwater from the storm, with the rock reflecting perfectly in it. The sight stopped me in my tracks. As I set up my camera to take the shot, I paused, remembering all that went into this adventure.

I packed up my camera, got in the car and headed back to the campsite. As I drove, in a bit of a let down state, I came across a lake boasting beautiful reflections of the Tetons.

When a waterfall decides to make its way through these lush landscapes, a scene is created that will stop you in your tracks and leave you speechless. This particular waterfall in Oregon was a priority on my list for a long time. The day had finally come, and my wife and I set out to enjoy its beauty. We drove for a few hours, only to be stopped by a road closure sign with a gate. A bit disappointed to be stuck after having our hopes high, we quickly realized we had brought two bicycles with us. We pulled over, gathered our equipment and set out up a steep highway. After a tough few miles we made it to the trailhead. A few miles of hiking into the forest and sure enough, there we were, stopped in our tracks, left speechless.

I aim to pour intentional emotion, symbolism, and narrative into each photograph; to say all and form a strong connection with the viewer without uttering a word. An important part of my evolving creative journey is looking at the artwork of others and working with artists. Mentors like photographer Stephen Ciuccoli and the forever-luminous paintings of Pierre-Auguste Renoir help shape my style.

Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only.

The image takes on a range of depth that translates my idea of the landscape into space that comes alive, where every subtle detail emerges from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights. The metallic, high gloss surface on a 10-mil 255g of the paper is scratch resistant which offers a layer of protection to the print and is museum archival quality. Because of the high cost of material, each print is custom made to order and is of a limited edition. The approximate time for delivery is 2 weeks from the time the order is placed. Experimenting with Fractals, Juxtaposition and Entropy. This work combines these essential elements with collage, creating new and unexpected imagery. I think of the work as painting with images, using multiple images to create each new and unique Artwork. Look closely and you will see that I am mixing up the various elements of the traditional landscape that create a new representation of what touches our feet and transitions to the sky. Entropy is not only an element of the process of making these images, it is a natural law of the world and of the universe we live in. Great change in our natural environment is all around us.

A moment suspended in time when these beings emerge from their primeval matter, before separation when their destinies overtake them with a promise of beauty and eternity arising from this original impulse. Interacting in a remarkable choreography with the romantic grace of a Gericault mixed with a powerful lyricism, they remind us of Rodin. The photographs are printed on high quality Hahnemühle Photo Rag Ultra Smooth 305g and mounted on Dibond (aluminum composite), which is a good alternative to aluminum. Weighing less than half that of aluminum this material is composed of a dark plastic core with a thin layer of aluminum coated on each side. This archival mounting solution is perfect for large pieces and a perfect alternative for archival framing and large print mounting. They are framed with a dark brown wood Float frame without glass (called ""Caisse Americaine"" or ""American Casing"").",49.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S-y52Z2nL._QL70_.jpg,7000.0,"[u'49', u'2', u'31 in.']","Babel,",B015HRMO40,31.0,1519.0,4.60829493088,4.0

Canada When you see a rainbow, it's often too late to try and photograph it, let alone find a suitable foreground for the rainbow. On this particular occasion, I was racing against time, driving down the gravel backroads in order to try and find a clearing in the sky through which the sun might magically appear behind the storm and cause a rainbow. After about 30 minutes of driving, the sun finally broke though the clouds, barely 10 minutes before it would set below the horizon, as one of the most magnificent double rainbows I have ever witnessed appeared. Still raining, I jumped out of the vehicle and proceeded to jump the ditch to get close to the bales. In my haste however, I didn't realize that the ditch was a rather large one and I ended up landing face first against the opposite side of the ditch. As I landed, I heard a slight 'crunch' and thought perhaps that I might have broken a bone! I slowly got up and to my amazement, I realized that I was fine, except for a few cuts and bruises, 'broken pride' as well as broken glasses! I quickly ran to my vehicle and fetched a spare pair of glasses from the glove compartment, ran back, safely jumped the ditch and finally reached the bales. I barely had time to make a half dozen compositions before the sun dipped below the horizon and ended one of the most spectacular double rainbow displays I have ever scene.

However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.). Uniforms, and outfits in general, send social signals that usually indicate personal and cultural identity. The idea of dress code works on many levels and is defined in many ways.

1833,george n. barnard,"This image was used by Barnard in his Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign (plate 20), but is here separately printed at a contemporary date in slightly larger format than the image in the book without clouds superimposed and on a period mount. ""Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign is a remarkable work of great symbolic, historic, and artistic power. It is a result of a complex interweaving of Barnard's personal vision, nineteenth-century pictorial conventions, and larger ideas about war and the American landscape. The album was the most ambitious project of Barnard's career, and has long been recognized as a landmark in the history of photography"" (Davis p.170). Barnard's album embraces scenes of the occupation of Nashville, the great battles around Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain, the campaign of Atlanta, March to the Sea, and the Great Raid through the Carolinas (1866). This album, together with Alexander Gardner's Photographic Sketchbook of the Civil War (1866) are the two greatest photographic monuments of the Civil War. Between them, they contain some of the most famous images of the War. Barnard's album would be the first great landscape photobook, ""but it is a wounded, brutalized land -- gouged and scarred and broken. Its tone is stoically calm, yet bleak, and is all the more so for being so lucidly understated ... [Barnard] shows himself to have been one of the finest landscape photographers, treating those culturally loaded Civil War sites -- already in the process of becoming mythic when he pictured them -- with respect, but also with a matter-of-factness that is heroic in itself, and served to punctuate the hyperbole of myth"" (Parr and Badger). The Battle of Resaca was the first confrontation of the Atlanta Campaign between Sherman and Joseph Johnston. It occurred in May of 1864. Though the outcome of the battle was inconclusive, the Confederates were forced to retreat farther south toward Atlanta.",14.25,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zw8bszEnL._QL70_.jpg,2000.0,"[u'14.25', u'0.01', u'10.75 in.']","Battle Ground of Resacca, Ga.

However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.). Uniforms, and outfits in general, send social signals that usually indicate personal and cultural identity. The idea of dress code works on many levels and is defined in many ways.

ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world.

While I was not born on the prairie, I adopted it many years ago after I made Winnipeg my home back in 1985. I particularly love the open spaces and always pay attention to the skies as they change in a moment's notice. The contrast between 'small trees and big clouds', along with the contrast of 'warm and cool colours', add a sense of wide, open spaces and vitality. I captured this canola crop in full-bloom with white puffy cumulus clouds one hot afternoon and created a quintessential mid-summer prairie scene.

Each artwork is titled (named) after a real-life experience in the artist's memory. About the process: Each Polaroid photograph is unique due to the nature of the instant photographic process. Once the Polaroid material is peeled away from the image, no photographic negative remains making reprints impossible. Each subject was photographed twice thereby creating an edition of two Polaroid photographs per subject. Because of how rare the film is, images from the 20x24 camera are quite expensive and renting the camera and its studio is also very costly. Polaroid Corporation stopped production in 2008.

2070,mike grandmaison,"'Chestnut-sided Warbler' by Mike Grandmaison Winnipeg, Manitoba. Canada My interest in bird watching goes back to my university years but I only recently begun to photograph 'dickie birds' as one of my university professors used to refer to them. Wildlife photography is an extremely challenging genre which requires above all knowing your subject. It also requires much patience although there is always room for a 'happy accident'. Wildlife is more active during periods surrounding dawn and dusk so that 'being there' will always give you an opportunity to see or create an image rather than staying home in the comfort of your bed. There are also many technical challenges involved in photographing animals. However, because of the smaller sensors found in many digital cameras today, there is much less of a need for the expensive telephoto lenses that generally runs into five to ten thousand dollars or more for professional quality equipment. With a moderately long lens like a 300mm telephoto, when combined with a high quality teleconverter, can produce the equivalent of a 630mm telephoto when attached to a digital camera with a small sensor, all this for about have the cost or less than the more expensive lenses. Wildlife is always on the move and one must often react very quickly. Because the light conditions are often far from ideal, wildlife photographers must frequently use the highest shutter speed possible in order to ensure that, at the very minimum, the eye is sharp. While I have discussed mostly technical details, framing the subject in an interesting setting with good background control is a tremendous challenge in the few seconds you may have to release the shutter. All of this to say that wildlife photography is very engaging. When I look at beautiful wildlife photography, I know just how difficult it is to achieve and I 'take my hat off' to those creators....",12.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FPfJR3yqL._QL70_.jpg,250.0,"[u'12', u'18', u'0.1 in.']","'Chestnut-sided Warbler' by Mike Grandmaison,",B01E3MTDIA,18.0,216.0,1.15740740741,0.0

Interested in the artifacts of our ancestors alongside the products of contemporary culture, I explore with the camera candid moments, gathering information and forms with which I later create abstract compositions. In my post-camera work, through duplication and reorganization of recognizable subjects, decomposing and recomposing architectural elements and objects, I am able to build new forms as well as stretch the limitations of the camera's format in regard to framing and composition. This process allows me to vary perspective, creating spaces with perspectives of their own. In my abstract landscapes, I often use reflected images to reveal layers of depth, color, light and shape as well as the play between positive and negative space, creating penetrable and impenetrable spaces, juxtaposing the aesthetics of the past and the present. It is most often in the urban landscape, where I find an endless palette of shape, texture and color with which to work. I am fascinated by the huge collaborative creative effort that forms the shape of a city, and provides a visual record that is at once historical and current. Through my process, I am able to organize and restructure the bombardment of visual imagery and the dense compression of architecture, design and energy experienced in an urban environment. While photography is traditionally a narrative medium, I ask the viewer to let go of the notion of the photograph as being a picture of some thing and focus instead on the imagery that emerges from recomposed elements.",40.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61bCtb8jBLL._QL70_.jpg,1700.0,"[u'40', u'30 in.']","Chocolate Mermaid 1,",B011AEC1S8,30.0,1200.0,1.41666666667,3.0

She draws an array of paradoxical patterns and images that evoke a delicate, nostalgic and often disturbing ambience to her drawings. Images of square robots, towering stacks of teacups, innocent woodland creatures, and sensuous blooming roses are omnipresent. Sarah creates her work using the most basic of tools - pencil and paper. Through her sketches, she manipulates the meaning of objects, changing the way the world is interpreted and often questioning the form and function of everyday objects. An important element to Sarah's work is collage. The formation of an initial collage is a brainstorming process for her in the creation of the final pencil drawing. The use of portraiture is a further development, starting with a picture of a face, to which she applies seemingly random images (such as shisha, a naked lady's leg, a vintage fan, etc), according to the gesture, depth and shape of the features. After the collage is done, Sarah will produce a pencil drawing identical to the collage. When both pieces are displayed together, one can feel the erotic ambience of both - through the colors from the collage and through the gestures and fragility of the pencil drawings. Walls provide a canvas that lacks the vulnerability of paper, yet giving a transient quality similar in nature to dreams- a vital element in her drawings Sarah seeks to recreate these dreams in an alternate realm through her sketches, a world where people escape from reality and remain innocent.",29.92,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61yPiuOttXL._QL70_.jpg,3800.0,"[u'29.92', u'0', u'21.65 in.']","Circus,",B0197Q1LXM,21.65,647.768,5.86629781033,3.0

Albumen photographs from negatives taken in 1866, 10 x 13 inches, on original two-tone gilt-edged thin card mount, 16 1/8 x 20 inches, with plate title and photographer's credit. A fine copy of a stunning image from Barnard's 'Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign', an album which is one of the two greatest photographic monuments to the Civil War and 'a landmark in the history of photography' (Keith F. Davis). A contemporary reviewer wrote of this image and its companions: 'These photographs... surpass any other photographic views which have been produced in this country - whether relating to the war or otherwise' ('Harper's Weekly', 8 December, 1866, p.771)This image comes from George N. Barnard's album titled Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign, embracing scenes of the occupation of Nashville, the great battles around Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain, the campaign of Atlanta, March to the Sea, and the Great Raid through the Carolinas (1866). This album, togther with Alexander Gardner's Photographic Sketchbook of the Civil War (1866) are the two greatest photographic monuments of the Civil War. Between them, they contain some of the most famous images of the War.This very sharp example of the photograph shows part of the northern Georgia battle scene after the battle in order to demonstrate the physical circumstances rather than the physical destruction or human loss. From the prominence from the photograph is taken we can see both the Etowah River and the Western and Atlanta Railway line. The Allatoona depot on the railway line was the object of the Confederate attack, which was repulsed after hard fighting, largely because Sherman had had time to prepare. Confederate General Hood had laid out a campaign to re-take Nashville, and this campaign was described in a speech that Jefferson Davis gave, which Sherman read in the local paper.Cf.

The artist is presenting pictographic self-portraits (here photography and dynamic oil painting) ""We are the balance of our genes, our cultural heritage, our way in life, our dreams, and also a product of the way others see us. When flattered or insulted, often we adopt it and use it. These derogatory or rewarding views participate actively in our personal development. Complicated, weak, bewitching, wounded, or hilarious, I think of these views as ""another me"" perceived from another person's prism- fashioned by his culture, heritage, and experiences. We develop ourselves with each encounter, as intimate artworks on the border of incomprehension. When you add ignorance and intolerance to the way others see us, you get preconceived ideas. ""Préconçue"" -Preconceived- is a group of pictographic self-portraits with which I try to illustrate, in a militant way using the ridiculous and the kitsch, some labels society likes to associate with women and femininity.

2205,david eubank,"Printed on Photo Metallic Pearl Paper, the prints are stunningly vibrant, sharp and exceptionally rich-looking. The image takes on a range of depth that translates my idea of the landscape into space that comes alive, where every subtle detail emerges from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights. The metallic, high gloss surface on a 10-mil 255g of the paper is scratch resistant which offers a layer of protection to the print and is museum archival quality. Because of the high cost of material, each print is custom made to order and is of a limited edition. The approximate time for delivery is 2 weeks from the time the order is placed. Experimenting with Fractals, Juxtaposition and Entropy. This work combines these essential elements with collage, creating new and unexpected imagery. I think of the work as painting with images, using multiple images to create each new and unique Artwork. Look closely and you will see that I am mixing up the various elements of the traditional landscape that create a new representation of what touches our feet and transitions to the sky. Entropy is not only an element of the process of making these images, it is a natural law of the world and of the universe we live in. Great change in our natural environment is all around us.

ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world.

In photography you can change the perspective of a photograph, to create a new way of seeing familiar objects by making a photograph that is 360 degrees. If you take the 360 degree photograph and lay it flat everything that we understand about perspective changes. It becomes skewed, bent, and out of proportion. Even though the subject matter is recognizable it isn't always comprehensible. One of the reasons for this is that the viewer is now seeing Renaissance perspective in a totally different way. Instead of one or two vanishing points in the photograph they become many and varied. This change in unlimited vanishing points is how the skewed, bent, out of proportioned look of the 360 degree photograph reorients and at the same time visually challenges the viewer. Joel DeGrand © 2001 Someone once asked Salvador Dali if he took drugs in order to make his surreal paintings. He said, ""Take me, I am the drug; take me, I am hallucinogenic.""",24.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31sggq%2BsQLL._QL70_.jpg,5500.0,"[u'24', u'76', u'0.3 in.']","Coupeville, Washington,",B00IRTBYVK,76.0,1824.0,3.01535087719,4.0

2282,sarah tse,"Sarah's elaborate pencil drawings have often been described as whimsical and sensual in nature, her inspiration continues to be derived from childhood memories, personal travels and fleeting dreams. She draws an array of paradoxical patterns and images that evoke a delicate, nostalgic and often disturbing ambience to her drawings. Images of square robots, towering stacks of teacups, innocent woodland creatures, and sensuous blooming roses are omnipresent. Sarah creates her work using the most basic of tools - pencil and paper. Through her sketches, she manipulates the meaning of objects, changing the way the world is interpreted and often questioning the form and function of everyday objects. An important element to Sarah's work is collage. The formation of an initial collage is a brainstorming process for her in the creation of the final pencil drawing. The use of portraiture is a further development, starting with a picture of a face, to which she applies seemingly random images (such as shisha, a naked lady's leg, a vintage fan, etc), according to the gesture, depth and shape of the features. After the collage is done, Sarah will produce a pencil drawing identical to the collage. When both pieces are displayed together, one can feel the erotic ambience of both - through the colors from the collage and through the gestures and fragility of the pencil drawings. Walls provide a canvas that lacks the vulnerability of paper, yet giving a transient quality similar in nature to dreams- a vital element in her drawings Sarah seeks to recreate these dreams in an alternate realm through her sketches, a world where people escape from reality and remain innocent.",17.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61qhuXBF9wL._QL70_.jpg,3600.0,"[u'17.99', u'0', u'24.02 in.']","The Dark Clown,",B0197QUQU6,24.02,432.1198,8.33102301723,3.0

Hand-crafted marionettes were loaned to the artist to incorporate into this series of four images. Inspired by Film Noir, childhood nightmares and European folktales, each tableau merely suggests a narrative for the viewer to consider. The artist imagined the notions of redemption, soothsaying and ruination lurking just beneath the surface of each murky hue. About the process: Each Polaroid photograph is unique due to the nature of the instant photographic process. Once the Polaroid material is peeled away from the image, no photographic negative remains making reprints impossible. Each subject was photographed twice thereby creating an edition of two Polaroid photographs per subject. Because of how rare the film is, images from the 20x24 camera are quite expensive and renting the camera and its studio is also very costly. Polaroid Corporation stopped production in 2008. Polapan Pro 400 Black & White is unavailable indefinitely.",24.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BXjxTpCdL._QL70_.jpg,4375.0,"[u'24', u'20 in.']","Descent (Marionette #3),",B01D3U8AJQ,20.0,480.0,9.11458333333,3.0

2369,wang qingsong,"From the artist's website: ""My photo shoot sets often grow into full-blown installations, such as in ""Dream of Migrants"" (2005). This term ""Migrants"" is very derogatory in China. It means aimlessly drifting population from one place to another, mostly from countryside to big cities to look for jobs. This group of people is called an ""unauthorized population flow"". The term hints at the risk of social instability. This ""floating population"" has special terms and is marked with demeaning characteristics such as bad personal hygiene, instability, and threats of dangers to others. In Beijing alone, there are nearly 3 million such people. They all hold a dream and look for opportunities when they flow from their hometown into big cities. They bring stimulus by way of human labor for urban development but they also bring forth a lot of unstable social factors, such as the plight of their children without papers to study in the city and lacking stable housing. This population is accustomed to being shepherded from one city to the other, helpless with little money and bad reputations. Some people recognize them as vibrant force, but most people regard them as human signs of social sickness. The array of derogatory terms to such population is often associated with ""Tramp, loafers, gangsters, rascals..."" I am empathetic to this ""Migrant"" population. I think they hold on dearly to their dreams and like to be recognized for their contribution to the constructions of China's cities as they attempt to fulfill their dreams of improving their lives. In reality, their dreams are often hard to realize, as their early dreams of moving to cities are in conflict with their harsh realities discovered only later after they arrive. In 1993, I moved to Beijing, also from a far away place, from Jinzhou, in Hubei Province.

Each artwork is titled (named) after a real-life experience in the artist's memory. About the process: Each Polaroid photograph is unique due to the nature of the instant photographic process. Once the Polaroid material is peeled away from the image, no photographic negative remains making reprints impossible. Each subject was photographed twice thereby creating an edition of two Polaroid photographs per subject.

Wagner's photographs reveal the process of artistic engagement with the contradictory quality of human existence: between a profound sense of connection to nature and the culture of industrial progress. That is evident in this early fire drawing, which he inscribes upon the nocturnal scenery like self-portraits, as well as in his likeness of landscapes, which reflect on man and nature as forms of appearance. The first monograph on André Wagner's work with essays by Thomas Bauer-Friedrich and Wibke von Bonin is published in conjunction with his participation in the 55th Biennale di Venezia.

In 1980 I received a National Endowment for the Arts grant to photograph this evolutionary process, so I picked up my 8x10 Deardorff camera and started the ""Pittsburgh Project"". This photograph is part of that project.

2506,joel degrand,"New/Perspectives: 360 Degree Photographs As humans it seems we are always looking for a new and exciting way of seeing or looking at reality, or enhancing our perception of reality by changing or altering the norm through various means. This begins when we are children. We find out early that we can distort our reality by spinning around and later we find out that we can do the same thing as adults by using drugs and alcohol to change our perception of reality. In photography you can change the perspective of a photograph, to create a new way of seeing familiar objects by making a photograph that is 360 degrees. If you take the 360 degree photograph and lay it flat everything that we understand about perspective changes. It becomes skewed, bent, and out of proportion. Even though the subject matter is recognizable it isn't always comprehensible. One of the reasons for this is that the viewer is now seeing Renaissance perspective in a totally different way. Instead of one or two vanishing points in the photograph they become many and varied. This change in unlimited vanishing points is how the skewed, bent, out of proportioned look of the 360 degree photograph reorients and at the same time visually challenges the viewer.

During winter, in generations past, these low lands were uninhabitable. They were always too sodden to sustain human habitation. In recent centuries technology has been introduced to subdue and shape this natural process of annual inundation, and the floods have been held back for a while. But now humankind's attempts to control nature have, once again, been giving way to larger forces. To some people these annual floods represent devastation, while others welcome them as representing a new level of nature's creativity. These winter floods bring amazing diversity with them - diversity of species and environment, and also extraordinary visual diversity. This brings further evidence of our confused and troubled relationship with the nature that most closely surrounds us.

ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only.

Their eyelids are still shut, their poses unstudied. A moment suspended in time when these beings emerge from their primeval matter, before separation when their destinies overtake them with a promise of beauty and eternity arising from this original impulse. Interacting in a remarkable choreography with the romantic grace of a Gericault mixed with a powerful lyricism, they remind us of Rodin. The photographs are printed on high quality Hahnemühle Photo Rag Ultra Smooth 305g and mounted on Dibond (aluminum composite), which is a good alternative to aluminum.

2652,joel degrand,"New/Perspectives: 360 Degree Photographs As humans it seems we are always looking for a new and exciting way of seeing or looking at reality, or enhancing our perception of reality by changing or altering the norm through various means. This begins when we are children. We find out early that we can distort our reality by spinning around and later we find out that we can do the same thing as adults by using drugs and alcohol to change our perception of reality. In photography you can change the perspective of a photograph, to create a new way of seeing familiar objects by making a photograph that is 360 degrees. If you take the 360 degree photograph and lay it flat everything that we understand about perspective changes. It becomes skewed, bent, and out of proportion. Even though the subject matter is recognizable it isn't always comprehensible. One of the reasons for this is that the viewer is now seeing Renaissance perspective in a totally different way. Instead of one or two vanishing points in the photograph they become many and varied. This change in unlimited vanishing points is how the skewed, bent, out of proportioned look of the 360 degree photograph reorients and at the same time visually challenges the viewer.

The auroras are one of Mother Nature's finest display of awe-inspiring beauty. I have spent countless hours and evenings for an opportunity to witness them one more time and to make a few images in the process. On this particular occasion, I had been thwarted from photographing a magnificent sunset because I simply could not find a suitable foreground driving through endless miles of boreal forest. Finally, after the sun had set, we reached a lake nearby and approaching storm and decided to pull over for a while and consider my next move. Within an hour, the northern lights began to dance and provided me with an excellent opportunity to photograph the aurora reflecting in the lake.

2698,mike grandmaison,"'Great Horned Owl' by Mike Grandmaison Bents, Saskatchewan. Canada Photographing birds is very challenging. They are often distant and move quickly. They also tend to be very skittish. Generally when I spot an owl or a hawk resting on a fence post or similar perch, the chances are that it will flight away by the time I am ready to photograph it. Because I have lost so many excellent opportunities to photograph wildlife over the years, I decided to be more proactive and prepared for the situation. Below is my technique for approaching and capturing the first few photos of wildlife from my vehicle. I generally travel with a 'wildlife camera' ready to shoot. That means that a proper camera and telephoto lens combination is sitting besides me ready to pick up and fire whenever the opportunity presents itself. I usually mount my 300mm VR (with vibration reduction capability on), coupled with the finest 1.4 tele-converter onto a DX format camera which, in my situation, multiplies the lens in front of the camera by a factor of 1.5 times resulting in the equivalent of a 630mm lens. The camera settings are preset to a 'wildlife setting' which means that, on auto exposure mode, I choose an ISO of 800, the widest aperture possible (f2.8 to f5.6) and the fastest shutter speed possible for the light conditions. I also learned that a vehicle can also act as an excellent 'bird blind' so I can shoot from inside the vehicle. Usually, once I spot an owl or a hawk, I drive past them at least one kilometer or a half mile (birds of prey have excellent vision). Then I turn around and drive towards the bird and, lower the window down and, at the last minute, stop on the shoulder of the road and click the shutter. Often, I still will only get one exposure but sometimes the bird will stay around a little longer. I always keep an eye on traffic and I proceed only if it is safe and if there ...",9.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YAhkzF9bL._QL70_.jpg,200.0,"[u'9', u'14', u'0.1 in.']","'Great Horned Owl' by Mike Grandmaison,",B01E3MT6G4,14.0,126.0,1.5873015873,0.0

However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.). Uniforms, and outfits in general, send social signals that usually indicate personal and cultural identity. The idea of dress code works on many levels and is defined in many ways.

While taking this 40 minute long exposure picture, my assistant who was standing next to me felt something touch his forehead. He said it felt like a droplet of water. Since I work in total darkness, and paint my scene in with light, we did not see anything. After I was finished with this picture, I shined a flashlight at my assistant, and saw a streak of blood across hie forehead. As we were leaving the haunted mansion, we stood in the foyer talking, and notice we could see out breath, like it was below zero. Funny, it was 60 degrees that night. This limited edition print is signed on the back, unless you specify you want me to sign on the front, and comes with a certificate of authenticity.

When flattered or insulted, often we adopt it and use it. These derogatory or rewarding views participate actively in our personal development. Complicated, weak, bewitching, wounded, or hilarious, I think of these views as ""another me"" perceived from another person's prism- fashioned by his culture, heritage, and experiences. We develop ourselves with each encounter, as intimate artworks on the border of incomprehension. When you add ignorance and intolerance to the way others see us, you get preconceived ideas. ""Préconçue"" -Preconceived- is a group of pictographic self-portraits with which I try to illustrate, in a militant way using the ridiculous and the kitsch, some labels society likes to associate with women and femininity.

ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world. Thanks so much for your interest in my work.

2823,mike grandmaison,"'Iceberg at Dusk' by Mike Grandmaison Eastport, Newfoundland. Canada Icebergs are one of the most awesome sights we can behold. Twice now I have been able to view these 10,000-year-old glacial giants in Iceberg Alley, an area stretching from the coast of Labrador to the northeast coast of the island of Newfoundland. Most of the icebergs that reach the North Atlantic come from 100 major glaciers in Greenland while the others come from glaciers in northern Ellesmere Island. About 40,000 icebergs calf from these glaciers to migrate to the cold arctic seas. Despite their arrival every spring, year after year we continue to be amazed at the site of icebergs which come in any number of sizes and shapes. While you can view them from the shoreline, I prefer to explore them from the boat of a private guide. I photographed this particular iceberg from the shore on three separate occasions within a 12 hour period. On the last outing, the iceberg literally crumbled in front of our eyes, a sight I had neither expected nor expect to ever see again. What an experience!

However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.). Uniforms, and outfits in general, send social signals that usually indicate personal and cultural identity. The idea of dress code works on many levels and is defined in many ways.

She would nonchalantly raise the just lit and perfectly rolled cigarette to her lips, fashionable nail polish glinting in the afternoon sun. And as I say this, I raise the camera to my mind's eye, and there I am with her in that secluded space where all of me is gathered, poised to act, to press the button. I look, I see, the shutter clicks. It all started as a child, much before I had a camera. Now I have one; and when I look at my own images, I discern a quest for harmony, for beauty and for peacefulness. As a man who lives through his eyes, this yearning, this insistence is always with me. I like working outdoors. Light, air and space are oxygen to me; and in general my images reflect that as they tend to be simple and direct- simpy look and you can see. In my world, pictures are about subtle transfers of energy; tiny realignments, really- no drama, no upheavels. These for me are true moments. And for all that I am deeply grateful to Paul Strand, Edward Steichen, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Andre Kertesz, Irving Penn and a multitude of others for teaching me to look at things simply and directly- for the rest truly happens on its own and over time. I am also grateful to and fascinated by the work of photographers like Bill Brandt for showing me that things and people will conform to how we choose to represent them; a reminder that each of us is often the creator of realities that are not just deeply personal but squarely beyond what is commonly known and accepted as the everyday experience.

2970,joel degrand,"Uniforms, Outfits, & Accessories We think of the word ""uniform"" to mean the distinctive clothing worn by members of the same organization. However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.). Uniforms, and outfits in general, send social signals that usually indicate personal and cultural identity. The idea of dress code works on many levels and is defined in many ways.

2994,eiffel chong,"Taken at different locations along coastal Asia, the photographs are united in their composition. Carefully orchestrated by Chong, each image alludes to man as a creator, defined however by the parameters set by nature. Be it a buoy, boat, seemingly abandoned pier, kitsch crab statue or conglomeration of skyscrapers in our familiar Hong Kong, the traces left by man are generously featured in the center of Chong's works. Blending into the lucid ocean and sky, the human world coexists with nature seamlessly in the fictional space skillfully crafted by Chong. With the help of the Neutral Density filter, Chong glosses his images with a pastel film, which gives his works a zen-like tranquil quality, almost too still at a first glance. However, carefully maneuvered is the same ratio of the sky to the sea across the series, which when displayed panoramically side by side, reflects the manifolds of nature's colours across time and space. Marveling at nature's unfathomable depths, Chong situates the human world comfortably within, celebrating the complexity of the expanse we create together. In a manner closely resembling Dutch Master oil paintings newly freed from the Catholic tradition, Chong's photographs adopt realism capturing the essence of the visible landscapes while experimenting with unconventional aesthetic practices.",50.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31I-zfvXpTL._QL70_.jpg,4150.0,"[u'50', u'38.98 in.']","Kuala Sungei Burong,",B01313XDYC,38.98,1949.0,2.12929707542,3.0

3015,gwen adler,"My current work, presented in New Fabrications: Portfolio 4, features photographic memories and architectural fabrications, chronicling material culture and the experience of architecture, in digital montage. Interested in the artifacts of our ancestors alongside the products of contemporary culture, I explore with the camera candid moments, gathering information and forms with which I later create abstract compositions. In my post-camera work, through duplication and reorganization of recognizable subjects, decomposing and recomposing architectural elements and objects, I am able to build new forms as well as stretch the limitations of the camera's format in regard to framing and composition. This process allows me to vary perspective, creating spaces with perspectives of their own. In my abstract landscapes, I often use reflected images to reveal layers of depth, color, light and shape as well as the play between positive and negative space, creating penetrable and impenetrable spaces, juxtaposing the aesthetics of the past and the present. It is most often in the urban landscape, where I find an endless palette of shape, texture and color with which to work. I am fascinated by the huge collaborative creative effort that forms the shape of a city, and provides a visual record that is at once historical and current. Through my process, I am able to organize and restructure the bombardment of visual imagery and the dense compression of architecture, design and energy experienced in an urban environment. While photography is traditionally a narrative medium, I ask the viewer to let go of the notion of the photograph as being a picture of some thing and focus instead on the imagery that emerges from recomposed elements.",40.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61wTy1LuecL._QL70_.jpg,1700.0,"[u'40', u'30 in.']","LA Walk 1,",B011AEC3WM,30.0,1200.0,1.41666666667,3.0

3021,joel degrand,"New/Perspectives: 360 Degree Photographs As humans it seems we are always looking for a new and exciting way of seeing or looking at reality, or enhancing our perception of reality by changing or altering the norm through various means. This begins when we are children. We find out early that we can distort our reality by spinning around and later we find out that we can do the same thing as adults by using drugs and alcohol to change our perception of reality. In photography you can change the perspective of a photograph, to create a new way of seeing familiar objects by making a photograph that is 360 degrees. If you take the 360 degree photograph and lay it flat everything that we understand about perspective changes. It becomes skewed, bent, and out of proportion. Even though the subject matter is recognizable it isn't always comprehensible. One of the reasons for this is that the viewer is now seeing Renaissance perspective in a totally different way. Instead of one or two vanishing points in the photograph they become many and varied. This change in unlimited vanishing points is how the skewed, bent, out of proportioned look of the 360 degree photograph reorients and at the same time visually challenges the viewer.

Trees beautify our surroundings, purify our air, act as sound barriers, and manufacture precious oxygen. They affect our climate by moderating the effects of the sun, wind and rain, they provide shelter for wildlife, and, last but not least, they act as a carbon sink by removing carbon dioxide from the air and storing it as cellulose in their trunks, branches, and roots. Trees however offer much more than practical benefits. Trees have inspired countless artists in their art and are fascinating subjects in themselves. Whether they are depicted as individual objects or as part of a forest scene, they offer the viewer limitless variations on the themes of line, shape, form, texture and color. And there is a tree for all seasons! I photographed these spruce trees in the boreal forest just as the sunlight was about to fade away below the horizon.

On some inexplicable level I feel a special connection with both domesticated and wild animals. In this series Animal Visions my photomontages tell stories about these relationships. While working on Animal Visions I found myself circling back to the influence of magic realism. In the early 20th century Latin American writers and artists used magic realism to create images, which with a simple twist go beyond the expected into the unexpected. In this series I have constructed images to tell unfinished stories, which initially might seem true and believable, but likely are improbable.

This beautiful energy has a very particular language: the colour waves, and these in turn are translated by the eye before landing into the soul. Finally, I reveal beauty by focusing on a specific situation until the anodyne becomes extraordinary, but without altering reality itself. Further to that idea, I never modify elements of a picture, merge different images or ask people to pose.

Weighing about 11 pounds, an adult's skin has a surface area of between 2 and 2.5 square yards. Throughout history human skin has been a canvas for artists. The history of tattoos includes marking slaves and outcasts, punishment, a rite of passage into adulthood or special societies, and in our modern society decoration. In this series of images I have focused on the female back, a canvas shape that lends it self to many different configurations. Each of the tattoos in this project has special meaning for the owner.

Interested in the artifacts of our ancestors alongside the products of contemporary culture, I explore with the camera candid moments, gathering information and forms with which I later create abstract compositions. In my post-camera work, through duplication and reorganization of recognizable subjects, decomposing and recomposing architectural elements and objects, I am able to build new forms as well as stretch the limitations of the camera's format in regard to framing and composition. This process allows me to vary perspective, creating spaces with perspectives of their own. In my abstract landscapes, I often use reflected images to reveal layers of depth, color, light and shape as well as the play between positive and negative space, creating penetrable and impenetrable spaces, juxtaposing the aesthetics of the past and the present. It is most often in the urban landscape, where I find an endless palette of shape, texture and color with which to work. I am fascinated by the huge collaborative creative effort that forms the shape of a city, and provides a visual record that is at once historical and current. Through my process, I am able to organize and restructure the bombardment of visual imagery and the dense compression of architecture, design and energy experienced in an urban environment. While photography is traditionally a narrative medium, I ask the viewer to let go of the notion of the photograph as being a picture of some thing and focus instead on the imagery that emerges from recomposed elements.",30.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518ByuYDIpL._QL70_.jpg,1700.0,"[u'30', u'40 in.']","Ohio 1,",B011AECGYM,40.0,1200.0,1.41666666667,3.0

Hand-crafted marionettes were loaned to the artist to incorporate into this series of four images. Inspired by Film Noir, childhood nightmares and European folktales, each tableau merely suggests a narrative for the viewer to consider. The artist imagined the notions of redemption, soothsaying and ruination lurking just beneath the surface of each murky hue. About the process: Each Polaroid photograph is unique due to the nature of the instant photographic process. Once the Polaroid material is peeled away from the image, no photographic negative remains making reprints impossible. Each subject was photographed twice thereby creating an edition of two Polaroid photographs per subject. Because of how rare the film is, images from the 20x24 camera are quite expensive and renting the camera and its studio is also very costly. Polaroid Corporation stopped production in 2008.

3286,joseph shields,"Archival Ink Jet Print. Signed Limited Edition #2 of 10. Printed on museum quality paper with torn edges and floated in 30"" x 24"" off white mat. Paper size is @ 22"" x 18"". ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world. Thanks so much for your interest in my work.

3375,joel degrand,"New/Perspectives: 360 Degree Photographs As humans it seems we are always looking for a new and exciting way of seeing or looking at reality, or enhancing our perception of reality by changing or altering the norm through various means. This begins when we are children. We find out early that we can distort our reality by spinning around and later we find out that we can do the same thing as adults by using drugs and alcohol to change our perception of reality. In photography you can change the perspective of a photograph, to create a new way of seeing familiar objects by making a photograph that is 360 degrees. If you take the 360 degree photograph and lay it flat everything that we understand about perspective changes. It becomes skewed, bent, and out of proportion. Even though the subject matter is recognizable it isn't always comprehensible. One of the reasons for this is that the viewer is now seeing Renaissance perspective in a totally different way. Instead of one or two vanishing points in the photograph they become many and varied. This change in unlimited vanishing points is how the skewed, bent, out of proportioned look of the 360 degree photograph reorients and at the same time visually challenges the viewer.

ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world.

It was in this familial context within historical colonial forestry practices, filtered through the contemporary environmental crisis, that the seeds of this series were sown.

Carefully orchestrated by Chong, each image alludes to man as a creator, defined however by the parameters set by nature. Be it a buoy, boat, seemingly abandoned pier, kitsch crab statue or conglomeration of skyscrapers in our familiar Hong Kong, the traces left by man are generously featured in the center of Chong's works. Blending into the lucid ocean and sky, the human world coexists with nature seamlessly in the fictional space skillfully crafted by Chong. With the help of the Neutral Density filter, Chong glosses his images with a pastel film, which gives his works a zen-like tranquil quality, almost too still at a first glance. However, carefully maneuvered is the same ratio of the sky to the sea across the series, which when displayed panoramically side by side, reflects the manifolds of nature's colours across time and space. Marveling at nature's unfathomable depths, Chong situates the human world comfortably within, celebrating the complexity of the expanse we create together. In a manner closely resembling Dutch Master oil paintings newly freed from the Catholic tradition, Chong's photographs adopt realism capturing the essence of the visible landscapes while experimenting with unconventional aesthetic practices.",50.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QsoZxRcZL._QL70_.jpg,4150.0,"[u'50', u'38.98 in.']","Pulau Bintan,",B01313XZ7C,38.98,1949.0,2.12929707542,3.0

On some inexplicable level I feel a special connection with both domesticated and wild animals. In this series Animal Visions my photomontages tell stories about these relationships. While working on Animal Visions I found myself circling back to the influence of magic realism. In the early 20th century Latin American writers and artists used magic realism to create images, which with a simple twist go beyond the expected into the unexpected. In this series I have constructed images to tell unfinished stories, which initially might seem true and believable, but likely are improbable.

3480,mike grandmaison,"'Red Maple, Dryberry Creek' by Mike Grandmaison Sioux Narrows, Ontario. Canada Sometimes a piece of art can have some strong emotional ties to a personal experience. I was visiting my dad who still lived in my hometown some 1,000 miles away from where I lived. He was dying and after a few days by his side, I needed to get away for a couple of hours so I drove to a nearby park. Autumn was in full swing and the distraction of being at peace in the natural world felt good. This particular image of a red maple sapling beside a slow moving brook is one that I had made within the last week or so prior to coming but when I saw it on my laptop, somehow there was a connection between that image and my father passing away. Sometimes art can have special meaning for the creator but often a particular piece of art can also resonate deeply with the viewer.

3572,george n. barnard,"(Pl. 24). (New York: 1866). Albumen photograph from a negative taken in 1866, 10 x 13 inches, on original two-tone gilt-edged thin card mount, 16 1/8 x 20 inches, with plate title and photographer's credit. A fine copy of a stunning image from Barnard's 'Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign', an album which is one of the two greatest photographic monuments to the Civil War and 'a landmark in the history of photography' (Keith F. Davis). A contemporary reviewer wrote of this image and its companions: 'These photographs... surpass any other photographic views which have been produced in this country - whether relating to the war or otherwise' ('Harper's Weekly', 8 December, 1866, p.771)This image comes from George N. Barnard's album titled Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign, embracing scenes of the occupation of Nashville, the great battles around Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain, the campaign of Atlanta, March to the Sea, and the Great Raid through the Carolinas (1866). This album, togther with Alexander Gardner's Photographic Sketchbook of the Civil War (1866) are the two greatest photographic monuments of the Civil War. Between them, they contain some of the most famous images of the War.This very sharp example of the photograph shows part of the northern Georgia battle scene after the battle in order to demonstrate the physical circumstances rather than the physical destruction or human loss. From the prominence from the photograph is taken we can see both the Etowah River and the Western and Atlanta Railway line. The Allatoona depot on the railway line was the object of the Confederate attack, which was repulsed after hard fighting, largely because Sherman had had time to prepare. Confederate General Hood had laid out a campaign to re-take Nashville, and this campaign was described in a speech that Jefferson Davis gave, which Sherman read in the local paper.Cf. De Renne p.1317; cf. Howes B150, ""b.""; cf. Sabin 3462; cf.",10.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rwUMIv7VL._QL70_.jpg,1500.0,"[u'10', u'14 in.']","Savannah, Ga.

Dating back to the mid-1600's, the market was created so its rent could support the upkeep and charitable activities of the nearby New Mosque. In its prime, the Spice Market was the last stop for the camel caravans traveling the Silk Routes from China, India and Persia. Today, the market still serves local Istanbul residents, however it has become more sanitized and touristy - feeling more like a modern, climate-controlled fashion mall rather than a centuries-old market with vendors barking out orders. That's why we found it so refreshing to step outside the market into the busy, bustling outdoor bazaar surrounding the market. Although this colorful section was established a mere 100 years ago, it felt older and more authentic than the Spice Market. Its narrow corridors were lined with fresh produce stands and fish stalls alongside storefronts selling kitchenware and toys for Turkish boys and girls.",18.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HwKA8B0ZL._QL70_.jpg,125.0,"[u'18', u'0.01', u'12 in.']","Spice Market,",B017C6P0NG,12.0,216.0,0.578703703704,0.0

In 1980 I received a National Endowment for the Arts grant to photograph this evolutionary process, so I picked up my 8x10 Deardorff camera and started the ""Pittsburgh Project"".

Carefully orchestrated by Chong, each image alludes to man as a creator, defined however by the parameters set by nature. Be it a buoy, boat, seemingly abandoned pier, kitsch crab statue or conglomeration of skyscrapers in our familiar Hong Kong, the traces left by man are generously featured in the center of Chong's works. Blending into the lucid ocean and sky, the human world coexists with nature seamlessly in the fictional space skillfully crafted by Chong. With the help of the Neutral Density filter, Chong glosses his images with a pastel film, which gives his works a zen-like tranquil quality, almost too still at a first glance. However, carefully maneuvered is the same ratio of the sky to the sea across the series, which when displayed panoramically side by side, reflects the manifolds of nature's colours across time and space. Marveling at nature's unfathomable depths, Chong situates the human world comfortably within, celebrating the complexity of the expanse we create together. In a manner closely resembling Dutch Master oil paintings newly freed from the Catholic tradition, Chong's photographs adopt realism capturing the essence of the visible landscapes while experimenting with unconventional aesthetic practices.",50.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31EJGPbEOTL._QL70_.jpg,4150.0,"[u'50', u'38.98 in.']","Sungai Batu #2,",B01313Y4GI,38.98,1949.0,2.12929707542,3.0

Carefully orchestrated by Chong, each image alludes to man as a creator, defined however by the parameters set by nature. Be it a buoy, boat, seemingly abandoned pier, kitsch crab statue or conglomeration of skyscrapers in our familiar Hong Kong, the traces left by man are generously featured in the center of Chong's works. Blending into the lucid ocean and sky, the human world coexists with nature seamlessly in the fictional space skillfully crafted by Chong. With the help of the Neutral Density filter, Chong glosses his images with a pastel film, which gives his works a zen-like tranquil quality, almost too still at a first glance. However, carefully maneuvered is the same ratio of the sky to the sea across the series, which when displayed panoramically side by side, reflects the manifolds of nature's colours across time and space. Marveling at nature's unfathomable depths, Chong situates the human world comfortably within, celebrating the complexity of the expanse we create together. In a manner closely resembling Dutch Master oil paintings newly freed from the Catholic tradition, Chong's photographs adopt realism capturing the essence of the visible landscapes while experimenting with unconventional aesthetic practices.",50.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31bMlrKWoDL._QL70_.jpg,4150.0,"[u'50', u'38.98 in.']","Tanjung Bidara,",B01313YE40,38.98,1949.0,2.12929707542,3.0

This is often where the real challenge lies, to make an extraordinary image of an ordinary subject. Because I am very familiar and comfortable with my surroundings, an intimacy exists between myself and my surroundings. Some of my best work is literally made in my own backyard! I captured this Tennessee warbler on a cold, morning in spring. I had set up a small 'blind' in the backyard close to my Nanking cherry bush. Each year I impatiently await the emergence of the flower buds so that I can capture images of songbirds with a backdrop of cherry blossoms. I waited patiently for nearly an hour when this particular warbler decided to perch itself where I could make an interesting composition.

3856,sarah tse,"Sarah's elaborate pencil drawings have often been described as whimsical and sensual in nature, her inspiration continues to be derived from childhood memories, personal travels and fleeting dreams. She draws an array of paradoxical patterns and images that evoke a delicate, nostalgic and often disturbing ambience to her drawings. Images of square robots, towering stacks of teacups, innocent woodland creatures, and sensuous blooming roses are omnipresent. Sarah creates her work using the most basic of tools - pencil and paper. Through her sketches, she manipulates the meaning of objects, changing the way the world is interpreted and often questioning the form and function of everyday objects. An important element to Sarah's work is collage. The formation of an initial collage is a brainstorming process for her in the creation of the final pencil drawing. The use of portraiture is a further development, starting with a picture of a face, to which she applies seemingly random images (such as shisha, a naked lady's leg, a vintage fan, etc), according to the gesture, depth and shape of the features. After the collage is done, Sarah will produce a pencil drawing identical to the collage. When both pieces are displayed together, one can feel the erotic ambience of both - through the colors from the collage and through the gestures and fragility of the pencil drawings. Walls provide a canvas that lacks the vulnerability of paper, yet giving a transient quality similar in nature to dreams- a vital element in her drawings Sarah seeks to recreate these dreams in an alternate realm through her sketches, a world where people escape from reality and remain innocent.",21.65,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515bSD4jqGL._QL70_.jpg,3800.0,"[u'21.65', u'0', u'29.92 in.']","The Troy,",B0197PKLCK,29.92,647.768,5.86629781033,3.0

Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only.

3900,eiffel chong,"This series is an exploration of Eiffel Chong's ongoing photographic series of abandoned space - capturing the rapid growth in the metropolises of Malaysia and Hong Kong, where collective and personal histories tracing the faint memories of contemporary society are revealed in print. Chong began this series in 2005. Chong's oeuvre is the Freudian notion of Death - a 'dear of extinction'. The images address this in-between state, portraying the pain that lingers not with a place itself but with the things left by human beings at a particular place. In the artist's words, ""the unbearable traumatic feeling in us wanting to know what will happen next after knowing what has happened."" Chong's practice revolves around the idea of fragility, of human life within the rapid flux of a city, and of built structure within an increasingly unpredictable natural environment. In viewing the works, the audience is confronted simultaneously with the remnants of the past, the emptiness of the present and the uncertainty of the future. By carefully interweaving notions of memory, place and identity, Chong constructs scenarios that hinge on the boundary of fiction and reality to play on the psychology of life and death.",31.5,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xOv0uvz3L._QL70_.jpg,2750.0,"[u'31.5', u'39.96 in.']","Untitled #19,",B01313ZF16,39.96,1258.74,2.18472440695,3.0

And as I say this, I raise the camera to my mind's eye, and there I am with her in that secluded space where all of me is gathered, poised to act, to press the button. I look, I see, the shutter clicks. It all started as a child, much before I had a camera. Now I have one; and when I look at my own images, I discern a quest for harmony, for beauty and for peacefulness. As a man who lives through his eyes, this yearning, this insistence is always with me. I like working outdoors. Light, air and space are oxygen to me; and in general my images reflect that as they tend to be simple and direct- simpy look and you can see. In my world, pictures are about subtle transfers of energy; tiny realignments, really- no drama, no upheavels. These for me are true moments. And for all that I am deeply grateful to Paul Strand, Edward Steichen, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Andre Kertesz, Irving Penn and a multitude of others for teaching me to look at things simply and directly- for the rest truly happens on its own and over time. I am also grateful to and fascinated by the work of photographers like Bill Brandt for showing me that things and people will conform to how we choose to represent them; a reminder that each of us is often the creator of realities that are not just deeply personal but squarely beyond what is commonly known and accepted as the everyday experience.

A moment suspended in time when these beings emerge from their primeval matter, before separation when their destinies overtake them with a promise of beauty and eternity arising from this original impulse. Interacting in a remarkable choreography with the romantic grace of a Gericault mixed with a powerful lyricism, they remind us of Rodin.

ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world.

ABOUT MY PRINTS My photographs presented here for Zatista are sold as archival ink jet prints on museum quality paper, the same medium I currently use for all my exhibition work. Prices listed are for matted prints. Mats are most usually off white in color (if another color is used, it will be noted). I leave a white border around the image on the prints and then tear the paper at the border edges. The prints are ""floated"" in the mat, with torn edges exposed, giving emphasis that these are original works on paper. Paper sizes listed may be off just a fraction since each sheet is individually hand torn. Feel free to contact me at if you have questions about how the photographs are presented or want to discuss a different presentation than what I describe here. I work with a master printer and offer my photographs in very limited, signed editions and each in one size only. Many of the images I offer on the Zatista site have been exhibited and included in the permanent collections of museums and cultural institutions across the country and around the world.

4038,joel degrand,"Uniforms, Outfits, & Accessories We think of the word ""uniform"" to mean the distinctive clothing worn by members of the same organization. However, in today's society the term is somewhat distilled and can be used interchangeably to denote outfits that are similar in nature, but not exactly the same, and not necessarily worn by members of an organization. The history of the uniform, goes back to the history of clothing and textiles. Textiles are defined as felt or spun fibers made into yarn that are netted, looped and knitted or woven into fabrics. They first appeared in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. From these ancient times to the present day, the production of textiles evolved and influenced how people clothed themselves. Uniforms, and outfits, are a decisive part of the human physical appearance and this appearance has a social significance in all parts of the world. Every society has a dress code that is well defined and understood by most members of that particular group. The dress code has specific rules, which in turn signal a message given by a person's clothing and the way it is worn. The message may indicate income, social class, religious affiliation, attitude, sexual orientation, marital status, or sexual availability. It may be seen in the clothes worn in the armed services, the paramilitary, the police, security guards, and the clergy. It can also be seen in shops, banks, post offices airports, bars, restaurants and hotels, sports teams, clubs, schools, and prisons. Sometimes corporations use uniforms to create a brand or corporate image. (The first service uniform registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office was the Playboy Bunny outfit.). Uniforms, and outfits in general, send social signals that usually indicate personal and cultural identity. The idea of dress code works on many levels and is defined in many ways.

The metallic, high gloss surface on a 10-mil 255g of the paper is scratch resistant which offers a layer of protection to the print and is museum archival quality. Because of the high cost of material, each print is custom made to order and is of a limited edition. The approximate time for delivery is 2 weeks from the time the order is placed. Experimenting with Fractals, Juxtaposition and Entropy. This work combines these essential elements with collage, creating new and unexpected imagery. I think of the work as painting with images, using multiple images to create each new and unique Artwork. Look closely and you will see that I am mixing up the various elements of the traditional landscape that create a new representation of what touches our feet and transitions to the sky.

The composition of each image is similar to that of a formal landscape with the photograph taken straight at the horizon. This formal consideration comes directly from the point of view and perspective one experiences when in the water immediately before passing through an approaching wave. As the wave moves towards the shore, the energy that propels its motion gives way to the ocean floor. The forward movement is slowed while forces push the wave higher and higher until a point where the wave seems to hesitate before the ocean's energy is released and the wave breaks. As this energy changes shape, the formal structure of the landscape breaks down and the seeming passive forms become active. This series attempts to capture this moment and attempts to create a shared experience between the photographer and the viewer. While the energy from the ocean is constant and ordinary, every wave is unique - an endless number of possibilities. Apart from the point of view chosen, my control over the choice of image is dependent on chance occurrence. Many waves pass by while images are captured but the choice to take a photograph is dependent on primarily aesthetic considerations. The right location, the right weather and wave conditions are all required and sought out but ultimately I have no control over the subject.

4166,stefan arand,"Toledo / 2014 In 2014 the artist and photographer Stefan Arand from Düsseldorf created this contemporary, emotional and exceptional work of the Spanish town Toledo, which belongs to the Unesco-world cultural heritage. It shows the picturesque old town of Toledo with its Cathedral Santa María dating back to the 13th century and the Alcázar from the 16th century, all of them uniquely imbedded in the Castilian highlands. The river Tajo which surrounds Toledo and 600 kilometers onwards divides Lisbon with its delta, is the geographical sculptor of this unique romantic island-like perspective in the middle of the countryside. Throughout the centuries the historical metropolis in the heart of Spain has been an inspiration to many visual artists like El Greco (1541-1614) or Joaquín Sorolla (1863-1923). The work ""Toledo/ 2014 is part of the series ""World cultural heritage"" that the artist has been working on for eight years. This large format piece is typical of Arand and stands out for its exceptional attention to detail. In the printed picture, the combination of large format and maximum resolution reaches new dimensions. The picture has an impact on the viewer not only when looking at it from a certain distance. If one looks at it closely, new perspectives unfold, without any loss of quality to the picture. This has the astounding effect of the viewer feeling almost like drawn into the picture.",62.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p6-0dvcTL._QL70_.jpg,15200.0,"[u'62', u'135 in.']","Toledo / 2014,",B00RKNIMFA,135.0,8370.0,1.81600955795,4.0

This tension has escalated with man's increasing disregard for the fragility of the environment and abdication of his responsibility to care for the earth. One particular issue is global warming which has had a significant impact on all living things. Climate changes will minimally upset and perhaps ultimately destroy ecosystems.

I've used origami in the past as props in my photographs, but in this series Cosmic Surgery the origami has become an integral part of the final image. The series has three distinct stages. Firstly I photograph my sitter, then print multiple images of the subjects face and fold them into a complicated origami modular construction, which then gets placed back onto the original face of the portrait. Finally the whole thing is re-photographed. Origami is very meditative, you can get lost in the world of folding for hours. It is also extremely delicate and fragile, so by giving each geometric paper shape somewhere to sit within the final image, the origami has been given a backbone. There is something quite alien about the manipulated faces, as if they belong to some futuristic next generation. In these portraits the children become uncanny, while their parents are seen in a more familiar moment. With the simple act of folding an image I can transform each face and make a sort of flattened sculpture.
